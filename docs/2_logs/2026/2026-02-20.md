### How infostealers turn stolen credentials into real identities

Date: 20 February 2026

- Modern infostealers have expanded credential theft far beyond usernames and passwords. These infections routinely harvest credentials alongside broader session data and user activity.
- The resulting datasets are aggregated and sold by initial access brokers. Credentials harvested from personal devices are routinely tested against corporate environments, cloud services, and remote access systems.
- Disrupting reuse directly reduces the operational value of infostealer datasets and shortens their window of exploitation.
