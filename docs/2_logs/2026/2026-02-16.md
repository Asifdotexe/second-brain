### Apple starts testing end-to-end encrypted RCS messages on iPhone

Date: 16 February 2026

- Apple is starting to test end-to-end encrypted (E2EE) RCS messages with the developer beta of iOS 26.4 released Monday.
- Apple announced plans last year to support the feature, and once fully available, it will let iPhone and Android users send encrypted messages to each other across platforms.

### Passwords to passkeys: Staying ISO 27001 compliant in a passwordless era

Date: 16 February 2026

- Passwords have powered digital authentication for decades. Passkeys, built on FIDO2 and WebAuthn standards, are like the latest GPS technology.
- More than 15 billion online accounts now support passkeys ;  double the figure from 2023.
- Password-related issues account for 20-40% of all help desk calls, says Gartner. Microsoft's shift to passkeys as the default sign-in method represents a significant industry move away from this support burden.
- Passkeys naturally align with multiple compliance requirements. Passkeys represent a fundamental shift in authentication security.
- Success requires risk-based prioritization, comprehensive documentation, and thoughtful management of the transition period. Passwork as a password manager provides enterprise-grade passkey support.

### Infostealer malware found stealing OpenClaw secrets for first time

Date: 16 February 2026

- OpenClaw is a local-running AI agent framework that maintains a persistent configuration and memory environment on the user's machine.
- The tool can access local files, log in to email and communication apps on the host, and interact with online services.
- HudsonRock had predicted this development since late last month, calling OpenClaw "the new primary target for infostealers".

### CTM360: Lumma Stealer and Ninja Browser malware campaign abusing Google Groups

Date: 16 February 2026

- CTM360 reports that more than 4,000 malicious Google Groups and 3,500 Google-hosted URLs are being used in an active [[malware|malware]] campaign targeting global organizations.
- The attackers abuse Google’s trusted ecosystem to distribute credential-stealing [[malware|malware]] and establish persistent access on compromised devices.
- The campaign highlights a broader trend: attackers are increasingly weaponizing trusted SaaS platforms as delivery infrastructure to evade detection.
- The findings were published in CTM360’s February 2026 threat intelligence report.

### After all the hype, some AI experts don’t think OpenClaw is all that exciting

Date: 16 February 2026

- Moltbook, a Reddit clone where AI agents could communicate with one another, was hacked. The incident is a microcosm of OpenClaw and its underwhelming promise.
- It is technology that seems novel and exciting, but some AI experts think that its inherent cybersecurity flaws are rendering the technology unusable.
- OpenClaw allows AI agents to post, comment, and browse on the website. The problem is that AI agents may never be able to overcome the thing that makes them so powerful: they can’t think critically like humans can.
- For now, the industry is stuck: for [[agentic-ai|agentic AI]] to unlock the productivity that tech evangelists think is possible, it can't be so vulnerable. “Speaking frankly, I would realistically tell any normal layman, don’t use it right now,” Hammond said.

### Flapping Airplanes on the future of AI: ‘We want to try really radically different things’

Date: 16 February 2026

- Flapping Airplanes is a new AI lab focused on finding less data-hungry ways to train AI. With $180 million in seed funding, they’ll have plenty of runway to figure it out.
- Flapping Airplanes is the name of the company behind a new generation of AI. The company's founder, Aidan Asher, says the company is not trying to recreate the human brain. Instead, it's trying to create a more abstract intelligence that takes a different path.
- Asher: We find it really, really perplexing that you need all the Internet to really get this human intelligence.
- Ben: One of the advantages of doing deep, fundamental research is that, somewhat paradoxically, it is much cheaper to do really crazy, radical ideas.
- Asher: Being able to scale up our ideas is certainly relevant to our company.
- Aidan: I think the current models live somewhere on that spectrum. I don’t think we’re very close to God-in-a-box, in my opinion. It’s possible that as you train models on less data, you really force the model to have incredibly deep understandings.
- Aidan: We’re not trying to be better, per se, we’ve got to be different. All of these systems will almost certainly have different trade offs of them. You’ll get an advantage somewhere, and it’s a big world out there.
- Asher: We are looking for exceptional people who are trying to change the field and change the world. We’ve actually had some really cool conversations where people, like, send us very long essays about why they think it’s impossible to do.
