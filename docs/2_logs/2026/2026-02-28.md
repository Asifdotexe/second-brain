# Week 09

## Artificial Intelligence & Policy Standoffs

**Speaking Points (15-Minute Deep Dive):**

**1. The Anthropic vs. Pentagon Standoff: A Defining Moment for AI Policy**
- *The Incident:* President Trump officially ordered all federal agencies to immediately cease using Anthropic's AI tools.
- *The Designation:* Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth took it a step further, formally designating Anthropic as a "[[supply-chain-risk|supply chain risk]]." The DoD accused Anthropic of trying to "seize veto power over the operational decisions of the United States military."
- *The Core Conflict:* The dispute centers around Anthropic's strict red lines. CEO Dario Amodei outright refused to permit their models (like Claude) to be used for mass domestic surveillance or to power fully autonomous lethal weapons that strike without a human in the loop. The Pentagon argued that *any* "lawful use" should be permitted.
- *The Industry Blowback:* This isn't just an Anthropic issue anymore; it's an industry-wide philosophical battle. More than 300 Google employees and over 60 OpenAI employees signed an open letter urging their respective executives to publicly back Anthropic's stance on automated weaponry and surveillance.

**2. OpenAI's Unprecedented Scale and Ongoing Drama**
- *The Meta-Raise:* OpenAI just closed a jaw-dropping 110 billion USD private funding round. This isn't just VC money; it's strategic infrastructure money. Amazon injected 50 billion USD, while Nvidia and SoftBank each put in 30 billion USD. 
- *The User Base:* They announced crossing 900 million weekly active users for ChatGPT; up 100 million just since October 2025. They also confirmed 50 million paying subscribers.
- *The Musk Lawsuit Escalates:* A newly released deposition shows Elon Musk directly attacking OpenAI's safety record under Sam Altman, claiming his own xAI (maker of Grok) prioritizes safety better. Musk's core lawsuit still targets OpenAI's shift away from its nonprofit roots.
- *Internal Policing:* OpenAI proved it's watching its own: they fired an employee who was caught (via analytics by Unusual Whales) using confidential product release dates (like for Sora and GPT-5) to conduct insider trading on prediction markets like Polymarket and Kalshi.

**3. The Rise of "Agentic" AI Workflows**
- *Perplexity's "Computer":* Perplexity launched an entirely new tool running in the cloud that executes complex, multi-step workflows independently using 19 different AI models. It's a massive bet on "[[agentic-ai|agentic]]" capabilities outgrowing standard chatbot interfaces.
- *The "Rogue Agent" Problem:* As [[agentic-ai|AI agents]] take control of digital lives (doing things like mass-deleting emails or launching unauthorized [[phishing]] attacks), a new security tool called IronCurtain launched to act as a safeguard against agents going rogue.
- *The Developer Shift:* A WIRED piece highlighted how the metric for a good developer is shifting from raw coding ability to being "[[agentic-ai|agentic]]"; meaning their value is now tied to successfully directing and orchestrating AI coding agents.

**4. Market Impact & Global Perspectives**
- *[[ai-psychosis|AI Psychosis]] on Wall Street:* The market had a brief, sharp selloff purely because of a single financial report by Alap Shah predicting that by June, AI would drive unemployment past 10% and crash the Dow.
- *Censorship in Models:* New research dropped showing that Chinese [[llm|large language models]] refuse to answer 145 politically sensitive questions at a significantly higher rate than American models, highlighting the growing philosophical divide in global AI development.
- *Suno's Quiet Dominance:* AI music generator Suno reached 2 million paid subscribers and $300M in annual recurring revenue (ARR), proving generative media is a massive cash cow.

## Cyber Security & Geopolitics

**Speaking Points (15-Minute Deep Dive):**

**1. A Relentless Week of High-Profile [[ransomware|Ransomware]]**
- *The Healthcare Crisis:* The University of Mississippi Medical Center was completely paralyzed by a [[ransomware]] attack. It took down their IT systems, blocked all access to Epic electronic medical records, and forced them to close *all* clinic locations statewide. Officials are actively negotiating with the [[ransomware]] group.
- *The Tech Sector Hit:* Tokyo-based Advantest, a massive global player in [[semiconductor]] testing equipment, had to abruptly isolate its entire IT environment after detecting a [[ransomware]] intrusion. 
- *The Vector:* A core reason for these attacks seems to be the [[cve|CVE]]-2026-1731 vulnerability in [[beyondtrust|BeyondTrust]] Remote Support. [[cisa|CISA]] had to add it to the Known Exploited Vulnerabilities catalog and gave federal agencies an incredibly short 3-day deadline to patch it or yank the software.

**2. Severe Data Breaches Exposing Millions**
- *The French Bank Registry:* Hackers successfully infiltrated FICOBA, the French national bank account registry. The Ministry of Finance disclosed that the breach impacted the data of 1.2 million user accounts, disrupting operations on a national scale.
- *PayPal's Six-Month Silent Leak:* PayPal notified users of a massive data breach specifically targeting their PayPal Working Capital (PPWC) loan app for small businesses. Due to a "software error," sensitive data; including names, business addresses, SSNs, and dates of birth; was exposed for six entire months before being caught.
- *The Hidden Cost of Data Brokers:* A new minority report from Democrats on the Joint Economic Committee highlighted the true scale of the problem: they traced $20.9 billion in consumer identity-theft losses back to just four major data broker breaches.

**3. The Realities of Modern Attack Vectors**
- *The "Shift Left" Nightmare:* The philosophy of moving security responsibilities earlier in the development cycle ("shift left") is breaking down. Because businesses demand "fast, good, cheap, and secure," speed always wins. Developers are overwhelmed. As a result, researchers found that 70% of malicious images in some registries contained hidden [[cryptomining-software|cryptomining software]].
- *Cartel Drones & [[atm-jackpotting|ATM Jackpotting]]:* Physical and digital crime are merging. The FBI reported over 700 "[[atm-jackpotting|ATM Jackpotting]]" incidents in 2025 netting over 20 million USD, where hackers target the ATM software layer to force physical cash payouts in minutes. Down south, the CJNG Mexican drug cartel was reported to be fully embracing AI, drones, and social media scams for operations.
- *Anti-Bot Evasion:* An open-source tool called Scrapling, specifically designed to bypass Cloudflare Turnstile anti-bot systems, was downloaded 200,000 times before its unofficial GitHub community account vanished.
- *CISA Leadership Turmoil:* In the midst of all this, the acting director of [[cisa|CISA]], Madhu Gottumukkala, was unexpectedly replaced after reportedly failing a counterintelligence polygraph required to view classified documents. The agency still lacks a permanent, Senate-confirmed director.

## Science, Supercomputers & Internet Culture

**Speaking Points (15-Minute Deep Dive):**

**1. The End of Eras in Space and Computing**
- *Artemis Landing Pushed to 2028:* NASA had to officially delay its highly anticipated Artemis Moon landing mission. Originally slated for 2027, Artemis III will now merely be a test flight. This massive schedule overhaul was driven by stark realities presented in a report from NASA’s Aerospace Safety Advisory Panel.
- *Sierra [[supercomputer|Supercomputer]] Decommissioned:* A poignant retrospective detailed the necessary death of "Sierra." Once the second-fastest [[supercomputer|supercomputer]] in the entire world, Sierra was composed of thousands of compute nodes and dedicated to performing ultra-secure nuclear simulations for the National Nuclear Security Administration. As tech aged, it had to be dismantled and recycled.
