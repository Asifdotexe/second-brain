### What 5 Million Apps Revealed About Secrets in JavaScript

Date: 18 February 2026

- Intruder’s research team built a new secrets detection method and scanned 5 million applications specifically looking for secrets hidden in JavaScript bundles.
- The results of applying our new detection method at scale were staggering. The output file alone was over 100MB of plain text, containing more than 42,000 exposed tokens across 334 different secret types.
- DAST is more expensive, requires in-depth configuration, and in reality is usually reserved for a small number of high-value applications. SAST, repository scanning, and IDE guardrails catch real issues and prevent entire classes of exposure. But as this research shows, they do not cover every path a secret can take into production.
