# Week 52

## Cyber Security

### RondoDox Botnet Exploits [[Next.js|Next.js]] Servers
- The What: A new botnet campaign dubbed "RondoDox" has been observed actively targeting servers running the Next.js framework by exploiting a critical vulnerability known as "React2Shell" (CVE-2025-55182).
- The Detail: Attackers are using this flaw to execute remote code on vulnerable servers, subsequently deploying cryptominers and malware. The botnet specifically hunts for unpatched instances of the popular React framework used for building web applications.
- The Impact: This poses a severe risk to web infrastructure, as Next.js is widely used by enterprise-grade applications. Successful compromise can lead to server resource theft (cryptojacking) or deeper network infiltration.

### Fourth Wave of "GlassWorm" Targets macOS Developers

- The What: A persistent malware campaign known as GlassWorm has launched its fourth wave, specifically targeting macOS developers through malicious extensions for VSCode and OpenVSX.
- The Detail: The attackers distribute trojanized versions of cryptocurrency wallet applications and development tools. Once installed, the malware grants persistent access to the victim's machine, aiming to steal sensitive credentials and crypto assets.
- The Impact: This highlights the growing trend of [[Supply Chain Attack|supply chain attacks]] targeting developers. By compromising the tools developers use, attackers can potentially inject malicious code into downstream software or steal high-value intellectual property.
