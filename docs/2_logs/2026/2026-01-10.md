![Patch Tuesday](https://www.bleepstatic.com/content/hl-images/2024/10/08/patch_tuesday_microsoft.jpg)

Date: January 13, 2026

- **The Event:** Microsoft's January 2026 Patch Tuesday addressed **114 vulnerabilities**, including **three zero-days** that were either exploited in the wild or publicly disclosed.
- **The Detail:**
    1.  **CVE-2026-20805** (Exploited): A **Desktop Window Manager (DWM)** information disclosure vulnerability. Attackers can leak sensitive memory data to bypass protections.
    2.  **CVE-2026-21265** (Publicly Disclosed): A **Secure Boot** security feature bypass caused by expiring certificates. Unpatched systems may fail to trust new bootloaders.
    3.  **CVE-2023-31096** (Exploited): A **Windows Agere Soft Modem Driver** elevation of privilege flaw. Microsoft removed the deprecated `agrsm64.sys` driver to fix this legacy issue that allowed SYSTEM-level access.
- **The Impact:** [[cisa|CISA]] has added the exploited flaws to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities catalog. Federal agencies are mandated to patch immediately to prevent [[ransomware|ransomware]] groups from leveraging these now-public exploits.

![WEF Report](https://assets.weforum.org/report/cover_image/responsive_thumbnail_webp_QCV9PYtw81K_YOp7U7Ic_Ht3IoEIEgPRnmWIYonSGZY.webp)

Date: January 12, 2026

- **The Report:** The World Economic Forum released its *Global Cybersecurity Outlook 2026* on January 12, revealing a major shift in the threat landscape.
- **The Detail:** For the first time, CEOs rated "Cyber-enabled Fraud" (deepfakes, manipulated financial transfers) as a higher concern than [[ransomware|Ransomware]], driven by the accessibility of AI cloning tools.
- **The Impact:** This signals a strategic pivot for defenders: while [[encryption]] attacks (ransomware) are stabilizing, the integrity of *communication* (is this video call real?) is becoming the new battleground.

![DeepSeek App](https://www.insurancejournal.com/app/uploads/2025/02/deepseek-app-on-smartphone-25028119378678-AP-768x512.jpg)

Date: January 7, 2026

- **The Scrutiny:** Following its rapid rise, Chinese AI firm DeepSeek faced a wave of regulatory actions this week, with Australia and France launching probes into its data handling practices.
- **The Detail:** Concerns focus on the app's data storage policies and potential ties to state surveillance, leading to bans on government devices in multiple jurisdictions as of mid-January.
- **The Impact:** This geopolitical friction highlights the fragmentation of the global "AI Stack," potentially forcing multinational companies to choose between Western-sanctioned tools and cost-effective Asian alternatives.

![Cerebras](https://theaiinsider.tech/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Screenshot-2025-09-26-at-11.46.06-3.png)

Date: January 16, 2026

- **The Deal:** In a move to diversify away from Nvidia, OpenAI has reportedly secured a multi-year compute agreement valued at over $10 billion with chipmaker Cerebras Systems.
- **The Detail:** The partnership focuses specifically on "Inference" (running the models) rather than training, utilizing Cerebras' wafer-scale chips to drastically lower the cost and latency of ChatGPT responses.
- **The Impact:** This is a direct challenge to Nvidia's monopoly, signaling that top AI labs are willing to fund alternative hardware ecosystems to reduce their dependency on a single supplier.

### Microsoft Report: DeepSeek Dominates 89% of Chinese Market

![DeepSeek Market Share](https://capacityglobal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/urlhttp3A2F2Feuromoney-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com2F862Fa62F1eb8334f407f9c61b28e788f8b862Fcm-microsoft1-12.png)

Date: January 13, 2026

- **The Statistic:** A new Microsoft AI Diffusion report (Jan 13) highlights that DeepSeek has captured nearly 89% of the AI user base in China, vastly outperforming local competitors like Baidu.
- **The Detail:** The report warns of a widening "AI Divide," where the Global South is adopting affordable, open-weight models from China, while the Global North sticks to expensive, closed US models.
- **The Impact:** This entrenchment creates a "bifurcated internet" for AI, where future software ecosystems in Africa and SE Asia may be built on Chinese standards rather than Western APIs.

### Historic Medical Evacuation from ISS (NASA Crew-11)

![Crew-11](https://cdn.kpbs.org/dims4/default/8cf7169/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1253x772+0+84/resize/1760x1084!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fnpr.brightspotcdn.com%2Fdims3%2Fdefault%2Fstrip%2Ffalse%2Fcrop%2F1253x940%2043%200%2Fresize%2F1253x940%21%2F%3Furl%3Dhttp%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F85%2F06%2F2af7dc874dea8039c7c243a3b4f6%2Fap26014814815837.jpg)

Date: January 15, 2026

- **The Event:** On Jan 15, NASA’s Crew-11 astronauts returned to Earth a month early aboard a SpaceX Dragon capsule, marking the first time in history that a medical emergency forced an early end to a station mission.
- **The Detail:** While NASA kept the specific astronaut's condition confidential due to privacy rules, the urgency required an unscheduled "splashdown" off the coast of San Diego to get the crew member to a hospital immediately.
- **The Impact:** This rare event tests the "Emergency Return" protocols that will be critical for future Mars missions, where a 10-hour flight home is impossible, highlighting the need for advanced autonomous medical tech in deep space.

### Breakthrough "Epigenetic" [[crispr|CRISPR]] Tool Fixes Genes Without Cutting

![CRISPR](https://www.sciencedaily.com/images/1920/dna-repair-genetic-mutation-damage.webp)

Date: January 5, 2026

- **The Discovery:** Researchers at UNSW Sydney have validated a new [[crispr|CRISPR]] technique that "switches" genes on or off by removing chemical tags (methylation), rather than cutting the DNA strand itself.
- **The Detail:** Traditional [[crispr|CRISPR]] acts like molecular scissors (risking unintended damage); this new method acts like a molecular "eraser," removing the "silencing" markers on genes to treat conditions like Sickle Cell Anemia without altering the genome sequence.
- **The Impact:** This resolves a decades-long biological debate and offers a significantly safer path for gene therapy, reducing the risk of accidental mutations or cancer associated with DNA-cutting methods.

### Airbus Launches "SpaceRAN" to Standardize 5G from Orbit

![SpaceRAN](https://mediarenditions.airbus.com/YxF8zRxCB6Xwb4_lGaCzXLd243twMw2ao3GX2bqRyf0/resize?src=kpkp%3A%2F%2Fairbus%2F38%2F676%2F676942-ttukbtg06j.jpg&w=2560&h=1200&poiX=50&poiY=50&el=true&t=fill-down)

Date: January 14, 2026

- **The Innovation:** Airbus UpNext has launched a demonstrator program called "SpaceRAN" to test a standardized way for satellites to provide direct-to-device 5G connectivity without proprietary lock-ins.
- **The Detail:** Unlike Starlink’s closed system, SpaceRAN uses a "software-defined" satellite architecture that allows standard commercial 5G devices to connect to satellites as if they were normal cell towers.
- **The Impact:** If successful, this creates a unified global standard for [[ntn|Non-Terrestrial Networks]], allowing aviation, shipping, and remote industrial sites to switch between satellite providers instantly without changing hardware.

![Yaogan-50](https://img.inform.kz/kazinform-photobank/media/2026-01-13/a26d1af9-17de-4c42-81e0-3adf4f799e79.webp)

Date: January 13, 2026

- **The Launch:** China Aerospace Science and Technology Corp (CASC) successfully conducted its first launch of 2026, sending the Yaogan-50 remote sensing satellite into orbit via a Long March 6 rocket.
- **The Detail:** The satellite is equipped with high-definition land survey sensors officially designated for "disaster prevention and crop estimation," though western analysts often associate the Yaogan series with electronic surveillance.
- **The Impact:** This kickstarts China's ambitious 2026 launch calendar, which aims to exceed 100 orbital missions this year, further accelerating the density of the Low Earth Orbit (LEO) environment.
