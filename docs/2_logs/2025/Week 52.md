# Week 52

## Cyber Security

### The "GrinchBot" Swarms: AI Agents Dominate Holiday Retail
- A new wave of "Autonomous [[agentic-ai|AI Agents]]" (dubbed GrinchBots) decimated online inventories this week, purchasing 40% of high-demand electronics within milliseconds of restock.
- Unlike older bots, these AI agents use "[[computer-vision|computer vision]]" to solve CAPTCHAs and mimic human mouse movements, making them nearly impossible to filter with standard defenses.
- Major retailers were forced to implement "lottery systems" for purchases, frustrating legitimate last-minute shoppers.

### Artemis II Mission Systems Withstand "Red Team" Cyber Drill
- Alongside the physical crew tests on December 20, NASA confirmed the successful completion of a classified "Red Team" cyber-defense exercise for the Orion capsule.
- Ethical hackers attempted to jam the optical communications system (O2O) intended for the upcoming lunar flyby but failed to breach the encryption.
- Ensuring the integrity of the data link is critical, as this will be the first crewed mission to rely heavily on laser communications from deep space.

### "Deepfake Family" Voice Scams Surge Over Holidays
- Security firms reported a 300% spike in "Grandparent Scams" during Christmas week, powered by high-fidelity AI voice cloning.
- Attackers used snippets of audio from social media (TikTok/Instagram) to clone voices of younger relatives, calling older family members claiming "emergency travel trouble."
- The attacks were highly targeted, using location data to know who was actually traveling, adding terrifying credibility to the calls.

Funfact: The AI just needs an ~3 second of your voice to learn your vocal pattern

## Artificial Intelligence

### EU AI Act: Final Compliance Deadline Looms for "High Risk" Models
- As the year ends, major US tech firms are rushing to finalize documentation for the EU AI Act's full implementation (effective Jan 2026).
- "High Risk" systems (including AI used in HR, healthcare, and policing) must now prove they have human oversight and bias mitigation.
- Several open-source projects have geo-blocked European users this week to avoid the legal liability of these strict new rules.

### Microsoft's Copilot "Year in Review" Feature Criticized for Hallucinations
- Microsoft rolled out an AI-generated "Year in Review" for Office 365 users, summarizing their work year.
- Users reported bizarre [[ai-hallucination|hallucinations]], with the AI inventing meetings that never happened or congratulating users on projects they didn't work on.
- The glitch underscores the ongoing "grounding" problem in Generative AI—it prioritizes sounding nice over being factually accurate.

**What is grounding?**
  Grounding is making sure the AI is tethered to facts. Without it, the AI is like a creative writer who invents a fun story instead of a reporter who tells you the truth.
