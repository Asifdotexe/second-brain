# Stoicism

You cannot control the storm, only the ship.

**Stoicism** is a user's manual for the mind, written by Greek slaves and Roman Emperors. Its core goal is **Eudaimonia** (Flourishing) by focusing only on what you can control and accepting what you cannot.

## The Dichotomy of Control

Draw a line in the sand.
*   **In Your Control (Internal):** Your thoughts, your actions, your character, your reactions.
*   **Not In Your Control (External):** The weather, traffic, what people think of you, the past, the future.

If you tie your happiness to things *outside* your control (like "I hope it doesn't rain"), you are a slave to fortune. If you tie it to things *inside* your control (like "I will bring an umbrella"), you are invincible.

## FAQs

*1. Is it about having no emotions?*
No. (That is lowercase "s" stoicism).
Capital "S" **Stoicism** is not about suppressing emotion; it's about not being *enslaved* by it. You can feel grief, but you shouldn't let it destroy your reason.

*2. Who are the big three?*
*   **Marcus Aurelius:** The Emperor. Wrote "Meditations" (notes to himself on how to be a good ruler).
*   **Seneca:** The Statesman. Wrote letters on how to manage time and anger.
*   **Epictetus:** The Slave. Taught that freedom is a mental state.
