# Deontology

The rules are the rules, no matter what.

**Deontology** (from Greek *deon*, meaning "duty") is an ethical theory that says morality is about following rules. Actions are inherently "Right" or "Wrong" regardless of their consequences.

It is the opposite of **[[utilitarianism|Utilitarianism]]** (which cares only about the result).

## The Categorical Imperative

Immanuel Kant (the father of Deontology) proposed this rule: **"Act only according to that maxim whereby you can, at the same time, will that it should become a universal law."**

*   *Translation:* Before you do something, ask: "Would it be okay if *everyone* did this?"
    *   **Lying?** If everyone lied, words would mean nothing. So, you must never lie.
    *   **Stealing?** If everyone stole, private property wouldn't exist. So, you must never steal.

## FAQs

*1. What if lying saves a life?*
*   **Utilitarian:** Lie! (1 life saved > 0 lives saved).
*   **Strict Deontologist:** Don't lie. Lying is wrong. If the person dies, that is the murderer's fault, not yours. You did your duty. (This is the "Murderer at the door" problem).

*2. Why use it?*
It provides clear moral certainty. You don't have to calculate complex math about "future happiness" every time you want to act. You just follow the Rules.
