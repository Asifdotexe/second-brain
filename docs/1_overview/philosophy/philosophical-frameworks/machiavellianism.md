# Machiavellianism

It is better to be feared than loved.

**Machiavellianism** is a political philosophy based on the writings of Niccolò Machiavelli (specifically *The Prince*). It focuses on the harsh, pragmatic reality of gaining and keeping power.

It suggests that a ruler should do whatever is necessary (lie, cheat, steal, kill) to maintain stability and authority. "The ends justify the means."

## The Fox and the Lion

Machiavelli said a leader must be both:
*   **The Fox:** Cunning and able to spot traps (Manipulation/Diplomacy).
*   **The Lion:** Strong and fierce to scare off wolves (Force/War).

Being just a Lion makes you dumb; being just a Fox makes you weak.

## FAQs

*1. Is it "Evil"?*
Machiavelli didn't think he was teaching evil. He thought he was teaching **Results**. He argued that if a "Good" King is too nice and gets overthrown, his people suffer in the chaos. Therefore, a "Bad" King who acts ruthlessly to keep peace is actually better for the state.

*2. Is it a personality trait?*
Yes. In psychology, it is one of the "Dark Triad" traits (along with Narcissism and Psychopathy). High-Mach people are manipulative, cold, and strategic.
