# Socialism

The community owns the factory.

**Socialism** is a political and economic theory where the means of production (factories, farms, offices) are owned and regulated by the community as a whole, rather than by private individuals.

Imagine a lemonade stand.
*   **Capitalism:** One kid pays for the lemons, owns the stand, and keeps the profit. The other kids work for a wage.
*   **Socialism:** All the kids pool their money for lemons, work together, and vote on how to split the profit.

## Core Principles

1.  **Public Ownership:** Essential services (Healthcare, Energy, Transport) should not be for profit.
2.  **Redistribution:** Wealth should be spread to ensure everyone has a baseline quality of life (Safety Net).
3.  **Cooperation > Competition:** Society thrives when we work together, not when we fight for resources.

## FAQs

*1. Is it the same as Communism?*
No.
*   **Socialism:** You can still own personal property (your phone, your house). The *economy* is socialized.
*   **Communism:** A stateless, classless, moneyless society where *everything* is shared. (Socialism is often seen as the bridge to Communism).

*2. Does it work?*
It's a spectrum.
*   **Democratic Socialism (Nordic Model):** High taxes, free healthcare, strong unions, but still has a capitalist market (IKEA, Volvo). Works very well.
*   **Authoritarian Socialism (Soviet Union):** Government controls everything. Historically failed due to corruption and inefficiency.
