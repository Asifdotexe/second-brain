# Nihilism

The game has no rules and no winner.

**Nihilism** (from Latin *nihil*, meaning "nothing") is the rejection of all religious and moral principles, often in the belief that life is meaningless.
It suggests there is no objective Right or Wrong, no God, and no "Grand Plan."

## The Crisis

Nietzsche famously said, **"God is dead."**
He wasn't celebrating; he was warning us. He meant that the old structure giving us meaning (Religion) was collapsing, and without it, humans would fall into despair (Nihilism).

## Types

*   **Existential Nihilism:** Life has no intrinsic value.
*   **Moral Nihilism:** Nothing is truly "Evil" or "Good"; those are just human opinions.
*   **Epistemological Nihilism:** We cannot truly "know" anything for sure.

## FAQs

*1. Is it just for edgy teenagers?*
It is often a phase, but it's also a serious philosophical starting point. Once you accept there are no pre-set rules, you are forced to ask: "Okay, then what do I want to do?"

*2. How do you beat it?*
*   **Through Art (Nietzsche):** Create beauty.
*   **Through [[absurdism|Absurdism]] (Camus):** Rebel and enjoy the ride.
*   **Through [[existentialism|Existentialism]] (Sartre):** Build your own meaning.
