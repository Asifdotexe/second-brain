# Philosophical Frameworks

A collection of goggles for viewing the world. 

Philosophical frameworks (or "schools of thought") provide the underlying structures we use to determine truth, morality, and meaning. Below is a catalog of the frameworks currently documented in this knowledge bank.

## The Catalog of Frameworks

### 1. [[absurdism|Absurdism]]
The belief that life is inherently meaningless, but that we should rebel against this silence by living happily and embracing the absurd.

### 2. [[cynicism|Cynicism]]
An ancient practice of rejecting social conventions (wealth, fame, power) to live a simple, self-sufficient life in accordance with nature.

### 3. [[deontology|Deontology]]
An ethical theory stating that morality is defined by a duty to follow universal rules, regardless of the outcome or consequences.

### 4. [[existentialism|Existentialism]]
The idea that humans are born without a pre-set purpose and must define their own "essence" through radical freedom and choice.

### 5. [[hedonism|Hedonism]]
A philosophy that identifies pleasure as the supreme good and pain as the supreme evil, aiming to maximize well-being through sustainable or instant joy.

A pragmatic and often ruthless political philosophy focusing on the acquisition of power and the belief that "the ends justify the means."

### 7. [[nihilism|Nihilism]]
The rejection of all religious and moral principles, often resulting in the belief that life has no objective meaning, value, or purpose.

### 8. [[pragmatism|Pragmatism]]
A practical approach that tests the truth of a belief by its "cash value"—if a belief works and is useful in action, it is considered true.

### 9. [[socialism|Socialism]]
A political and economic framework where resources and the means of production are owned by the community to promote cooperation and equality.

A resilience-based philosophy that focuses on mastering one's internal state and accepting external events as being outside our control.
