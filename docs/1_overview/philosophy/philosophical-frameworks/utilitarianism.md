# Utilitarianism

The greatest good for the greatest number.

**Utilitarianism** is an ethical theory that says: The "Right" thing to do is whatever maximizes happiness and minimizes suffering for the most people.

It treats morality like a math equation. Intentions don't matter; rules don't matter. Only the **Consequences** (the result) matter.

## The Trolley Problem

This is the classic test for Utilitarianism.
*   A train is about to kill **5 people**.
*   You can pull a lever to switch tracks, where it will only kill **1 person**.
*   **Utilitarian Answer:** Pull the lever. 1 death is better than 5 deaths. (Math).
*   **Non-Utilitarian ([[deontology|Deontology]]) Answer:** Do not pull. Killing an innocent person is wrong, regardless of the outcome.

## FAQs

*1. Is it perfect?*
No. The flaw is the **"Minority Rights"** problem.
If killing one healthy person and harvesting their organs could save 5 dying patients, strict Utilitarianism might say "Do it" (1 death saves 5). But almost everyone agrees that murdering an innocent person for parts is wrong, even if the math works out.

*2. Who started it?*
*   **Jeremy Bentham:** The founder. "Nature has placed mankind under the governance of two sovereign masters, pain and pleasure."
*   **John Stuart Mill:** Refined it. He argued that "Qualitative" pleasures (poetry, friendship) are better than "Quantitative" pleasures (eating, drinking).
