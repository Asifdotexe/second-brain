# Hedonism

Pleasure is the only compass.

**Hedonism** is the belief that Pleasure is the supreme Good, and Pain is the supreme Evil. Therefore, the goal of life is to maximize pleasure and minimize pain.

While often associated with partying and excess, philosophical Hedonism is often more subtle.

## Types of Hedonism

1.  **Cyrenaic (The Party Animal):** Instant bodily pleasure (food, drink, sex) is the best. "Eat, drink, and be merry, for tomorrow we die."
2.  **Epicurean (The Connoisseur):** Sustainable pleasure. Avoiding pain (anxiety/fear) is more important than chasing highs. A simple meal with friends is better than a banquet that gives you a hangover.

## FAQs

*1. Is it selfish?*
Not necessarily. [[utilitarianism|Utilitarianism]] is a form of "Social Hedonism", trying to maximize the total happiness for *everyone* in society (The greatest good for the greatest number).

*2. What is the "Hedonic Treadmill"?*
The problem where humans quickly return to a stable level of happiness. You buy a new car (Pleasure spike), but after a month, it's just "your car" (Neutral). Hedonism often fails because you need bigger and bigger doses to feel the same high.
