# Reasoning

The three engines of thought.

There are three main ways humans (and AI) move from "what we know" to "what we think."

## 1. Deduction (The Sniper)
Moving from **General** to **Specific**.
If the premises are true, the conclusion **MUST** be true.
*   *Rule:* All men are mortal.
*   *Observation:* Socrates is a man.
*   *Conclusion:* Therefore, Socrates is mortal. (100% Certainty).

## 2. Induction (The Surveyor)
Moving from **Specific** to **General**.
Looking at patterns to form a rule. The conclusion is **Likely**, but not certain.
*   *Observation:* The sun has risen every morning for history.
*   *Conclusion:* Therefore, the sun will rise tomorrow. (High Probability, but not guaranteed. The sun could explode tonight).

## 3. Abduction (The Detective)
Inference to the **Best Explanation**.
Looking at a weird fact and guessing the most likely cause.
*   *Observation:* The grass is wet.
*   *Hypotheses:* It rained? The sprinklers turned on? A dog peed?
*   *Conclusion:* It rained (because the street is also wet).

## FAQs

*1. Which does Science use?*
All of them.
*   **Abduction** to invent a hypothesis.
*   **Deduction** to predict what should happen if the hypothesis is true.
*   **Induction** to verify it with data.

*2. Which does AI use?*
Machine Learning is a massive **Induction** engine. It looks at millions of specific cat photos to learn the general rule of "What a cat looks like."
