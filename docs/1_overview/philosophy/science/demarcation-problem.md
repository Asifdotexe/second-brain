# Demarcation Problem

Drawing the line in the sand.

The **Demarcation Problem** is the philosophical difficulty of distinguishing between **Science** (Astronomy, Chemistry) and **Non-Science/Pseudoscience** (Astrology, Alchemy).

Where exactly does one end and the other begin? It sounds easy, but there is no single agreed-upon rule that works 100% of the time.

## Key Criteria Attempts

1.  **Falsifiability (Popper):** If you can't test it, it's not science. (The Gold Standard).
2.  **Consensus:** If most scientists agree, it's science. (Problem: Scientists used to agree on bad ideas).
3.  **Method:** Does it use the Scientific Method? (Hypothesis -> Experiment -> Result).

## FAQs

*1. Why does it matter?*
It decides what gets taught in schools, what gets government funding, and what evidence is allowed in courtrooms. If we can't define science, we can't protect it from nonsense.

*2. Is "Non-Science" bad?*
Not necessarily. **Art**, **Philosophy**, and **Religion** are non-science, but they are valuable. **Pseudoscience** (fake science claiming to be real, like Phrenology) is the danger.
