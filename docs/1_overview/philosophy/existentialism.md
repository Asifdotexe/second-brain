# Existentialism

You contain the paintbrush, not just the canvas.

For objects (like a knife), **Essence precedes Existence**. (A blacksmith thinks "I need something to cut," designs a knife, and then makes it). The *purpose* comes first.

For humans, **Existence precedes Essence**. You are born first (You exist), and you have NO built-in purpose. You are a blank slate. You must *create* your own essence through your choices.

## The Burden of Freedom

Jean-Paul Sartre said we are **"Condemned to be free."**
Because there is no God/Destiny/Nature telling you what to do, *everything* you do is your fault.
*   You didn't "have to" work that job. You chose it.
*   You didn't "have to" get angry. You chose it.
This responsibility creates "Existential Dread" (Anxiety).

## FAQs

*1. Isn't this depressing?*
It can be scary, but it is also empowering. It means you are not stuck. You can change your "essence" at any moment. You are the author of your life, not just an actor reading a script.

*2. Who are the big names?*
*   **Sartre:** Radical freedom.
*   **Nietzsche:** Becoming the "Ubermensch" (Superman) by creating your own values.
*   **Kierkegaard:** Taking the "Leap of Faith."
