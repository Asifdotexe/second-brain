# Agency & Free Will

The ghost in the machine.

**Agency** is the capacity to act. A thermostat has agency (it gets hot -> it turns on fan).
**Free Will** is the capacity to *choose* how to act, free from external force or internal programming.

The debate is: Do humans have Free Will, or are we just very complex biological thermostats?

## Determinism vs. Volition

*   **Determinism (The Machine):** The universe is a chain of cause-and-effect. Your brain is made of atoms. Atoms obey physics. Therefore, your "choice" to eat pizza was calculated by the Big Bang bits in your brain. You couldn't have chosen otherwise.
*   **Libertarian Free Will (The Soul):** There is a "You" (Consciousness) that sits above the atoms and can veto the programming.

## The AI Mirror

We are building **Agentic AI** which clearly has Agency (it can book flights, write code).
But it strictly lacks Free Will. It is deterministic code.
*   If we are just biological machines, then AI is exactly like us.
*   If we have Free Will, then there is a "Special Sauce" in biology that silicon might never replicate.

## FAQs

*1. Does Physics allow Free Will?*
Classically (Newton)? No.
Quantumly? Maybe. Quantum mechanics introduces randomness. But "Randomness" (a dice roll) isn't the same as "Freedom" (a choice).

*2. Why does it matter?*
**Justice.** If you have no free will, you aren't "guilty" of a crime; you are just a broken machine. Our entire legal system assumes you *could* have chosen not to commit the crime.
