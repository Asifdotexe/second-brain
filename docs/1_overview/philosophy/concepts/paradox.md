# Paradox

A truth that sounds like a lie.

A **Paradox** is a statement that contradicts itself on the surface, but upon deeper reflection, reveals a truth (or exposes a flaw in our logic).

It breaks your brain's autopilot and forces you to think.

## Famous Examples

### 1. The Ship of Theseus (Identity)
If you replace one plank of a wooden ship every year, until every single part has been replaced... is it still the same ship?
*   *If yes:* But every physical piece is different!
*   *If no:* At what point did it become a new ship?

### 2. The Liar's Paradox (Truth)
"This sentence is false."
*   If it represents the truth -> Then it is false.
*   If it represents a lie -> Then it is true.
It creates an infinite loop.

### 3. The Tolerance Paradox (Society)
"Should a tolerant society tolerate intolerance?"
If you tolerate Nazis (intolerance), they will destroy the tolerant society. Therefore, to be tolerant, you must be *intolerant* of intolerance.

## FAQs

*1. Why do philosophers love them?*
They act as "Stress Tests" for our definitions. We think we know what "Same" means, until the Ship of Theseus proves we don't.
