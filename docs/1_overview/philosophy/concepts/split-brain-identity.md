# Split-Brain Experiment

The Split-Brain Identity problem is like asking what happens to a computer program if you suddenly split its CPU and [[hard-drive|hard drive]] in half and start running both halves on two separate, independent machines simultaneously.

**The Split-Brain Experiment** in philosophy is a thought experiment challenging personal identity by asking what happens to the "self" if the two hemispheres of a human brain are separated and placed into two different bodies.

We know from medical science that the left and right hemispheres of the human brain can function somewhat independently. In extreme medical treatments for severe epilepsy, patients have had the connection between their hemispheres severed, or even had half of their brain completely removed, yet they still survive and maintain their consciousness. The philosophical experiment pushes this reality further: what if you had an identical twin with a fatal brain defect, and you decided to save them by giving them half of your brain?

When the surgery is done, both you and your twin's body contain half of your original brain. DNA is identical, and since the brain data is duplicated, your twin wakes up with your exact personality, thoughts, and memories. The paradox is this: *why did you wake up in your own body?* Since both bodies contain your brain, why isn't your consciousness split between the two? If the standard [[brain-theory|Brain Theory]] says your identity follows your brain, how can it exist in two physical locations, behaving as two completely disconnected people?

## Breaking Identity Frameworks
*   **Fails the [[brain-theory|Brain Theory]]:** If identity lives in the physical brain, splitting the brain creates a paradox where two independent people have equal claim to being the original identity.
*   **Fails the [[data-theory|Data Theory]]:** Because the "data" of your personality now exists in two places, the original unified "self" ceases to exist as a single entity.
*   **Supports the [[body-theory|Body Theory]]:** The reason you likely feel you would wake up in your own body and view the other half as a clone is because *your original body* remains intact. This gives a massive philosophical boost to the idea that your physical body grounds your identity.

## FAQs

*1. Can a person really survive with half a brain?*
Yes. A procedure called a hemispherectomy removes or disables one half of the brain. The remaining half is highly adaptable (neuroplasticity) and can often learn to take over the missing half's functions, allowing the person to live a relatively normal life.

*2. If both twins have my memories, do they share a mind?*
No. Even though they start from the exact same save point, the split creates two separate streams of consciousness. The moment they wake up, they start forming different memories and become two distinct people who just happen to share the exact same past.
