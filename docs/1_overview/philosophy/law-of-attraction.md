# Law of Attraction

Like attracts like.

The **Law of Attraction** is the belief that positive or negative thoughts bring positive or negative experiences into a person's life.
**"Thoughts become Things."**

It suggests that if you focus intensely on a goal (visualize it, feel it as if it's already true), the Universe will conspire to make it happen.

## Is it Magic or Psychology?

*   **The Mystical View:** Your thoughts send out energy vibrations that magnetically attract similar energy from the Universe.
*   **The Psychological View (Confirmation Bias):** If you decide to buy a Red Tesla, you suddenly see Red Teslas everywhere. Because you are focused on "Success," your brain subconsciously notices opportunities for success that you would have ignored before.

## FAQs

*1. Does it work?*
*   **Scientifically:** There is no proof that thoughts change physical reality directly (telekinesis).
*   **Practically:** Positive thinking and visualization *do* improve confidence and performance, which leads to better results.

*2. What is the danger?*
**Victim Blaming.** If you believe "You attract what you think," it implies that if someone gets sick or poor, they "attracted" it with bad thoughts, which is cruel and untrue.
