# Post Hoc Fallacy

The Rain Dance.

**Post Hoc Ergo Propter Hoc** (Latin for "After this, therefore because of this") is the assumption that because Event B followed Event A, Event A *caused* Event B.

Think of it like **The Rain Dance**.
*   **The Event:** I did a dance. Then it rained.
*   **The Fallacy:** "My dance caused the rain."
*   **The Reality:** Correlation is not Causation. The rain was coming anyway.

## How it Works

1.  **Observation:** "I wore my lucky socks." -> "My team won the game."
2.  **Assumption:** "My socks made them win."
3.  **Error:** Ignoring coincidence or other factors (the team practiced hard).

## FAQs

*1. Correlation vs. Causation?*
This is the core of the fallacy.
*   **Correlation:** Ice cream sales and murder rates go up at the same time (Summer).
*   **Causation:** Ice cream does not cause murder. Heat causes both.

*2. Why do we believe it?*
Our brains are pattern-matching machines. We evolved to survive by finding causes ("I ate berry -> I got sick"). We are prone to "False Positives" (Superstitions).
