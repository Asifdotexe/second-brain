# Argument from Incredulity

Assuming magic must be real because you personally do not know the trick the magician used.

The **Argument from Incredulity** (or Appeal to Common Sense) is a logical fallacy where a person concludes that because a claim sounds unbelievable, difficult to imagine, or lacks a currently obvious explanation, it must be inherently false. 

Human intuition is highly grounded in our day-to-day survival, which makes us very bad at conceptualizing massive scales (like deep time, quantum physics, or macro-economics). When confronted with these complex concepts, our brain’s default reaction is to reject them as "absurd," substituting a simpler, more intuitive explanation instead.

## The Structure of the Error

This fallacy follows a very simple flawed logic path:
1.  I cannot imagine how $X$ could be true.
2.  Therefore, $X$ is false.

For example, looking at the complex structure of a human eye and saying, *"I simply cannot imagine how random mutations over time could create something this perfect, therefore evolution must be false."* The flaw is that *your* personal inability to imagine a mechanism has zero bearing on the objective reality of the biology.

## FAQs

*1. Why do we fall for this?*
Because our brains prefer efficiency over accuracy. It takes immense cognitive effort to process complex, counter-intuitive data (like [[quantum-computing|Quantum Mechanics]]), so the brain shortcuts to "That doesn't make sense, I reject it."

*2. How do I counter it in a debate?*
Gently separate the person's *understanding* from the *evidence*. You can say, "It is entirely counter-intuitive and very difficult to wrap your head around, but here is the raw data that shows it happens regardless of how weird it feels."
