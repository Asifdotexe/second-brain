# Tautology

The ATM Machine.

**A Tautology** is a statement that is true by necessity or by virtue of its logical form. In rhetoric, it often appears as a redundant statement that adds no new information, similar to [[circular-reasoning|Circular Reasoning]].

Think of it like **The ATM Machine**.
*   **The Phrase:** "ATM Machine" (Automated Teller Machine Machine). The word "Machine" is already in "ATM".
*   **The Logic:** "It is what it is." "The unwashed are those who generally remain unclean."

## How it Works

1.  **The Loop:** A = A.
2.  **The Filler:** It sounds profound ("Boys will be boys") but essentially says "Boys will be [what boys are]." It defines a thing by itself.
3.  **The Trap:** In logic, a tautology is *always true* (A or not A), but in debate, it is *useless* because it proves nothing about the real world.

## FAQs

*1. Is it a fallacy?*
Not strictu sensu. A tautology is logically *valid* (true). But using it as an *argument* is fallacious because it is empty. "We will win because we are the winners."
