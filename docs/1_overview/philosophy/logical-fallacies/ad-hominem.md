# Ad Hominem

Shooting the Messenger.

**Ad Hominem** (Latin for "To the Person") is a fallacy where you attack the *character* or *circumstances* of the person making the argument, rather than the argument itself.

Think of it like **A Broken Clock**.
*   **The Reality:** Even a broken clock is right twice a day. Even a rude, hypocritical, or unlikable person can make a mathematically correct statement.
*   **The Fallacy:** "You can't believe the clock is showing 12:00 because the clock is ugly and rusty." The rust has nothing to do with the time.

## How it Works

1.  **Avoidance:** You can't think of a logical counter-argument.
2.  **Deflection:** You shift focus to the opponent's traits (appearance, past actions, intelligence). "You're wrong about the tax code because you cheated on your wife."
3.  **Invalidation:** The audience assumes bad person = bad idea.

## FAQs

*1. Is an insult always an Ad Hominem?*
No.
*   **Insult:** "You are an idiot." (Rude, but not a fallacy if it's just an exclamation).
*   **Ad Hominem:** "You are wrong *because* you are an idiot." (Fallacy: linking the claim's validity to the insult).

*2. When is character relevant?*
If the argument *is* about their character. In a trial for fraud, the defendant's honesty *is* the topic. But in a debate about climate change, the scientist's tax returns are usually irrelevant to the data.
