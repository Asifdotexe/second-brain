# Logical Fallacies

Flaws in the mental plumbing.

Logical fallacies are errors in reasoning that invalidate an argument. They are cognitive shortcuts, emotional deflections, or structural glitches that distract from the truth. Below is a catalog of the fallacies currently documented in this knowledge bank.

## The Catalog of Fallacies

### 1. [[ad-hominem|Ad Hominem]]
"To the Person": Attacking the character or circumstances of the opponent rather than addressing their actual argument.

### 2. [[appeal-to-authority|Appeal to Authority]]
Claiming something is true solely because an "expert" or famous person said it, without offering supporting data.

### 3. [[circular-reasoning|Circular Reasoning]]
A loop where the conclusion is already assumed in the premise, essentially proving nothing but the assumption itself.

### 4. [[false-dilemma|False Dilemma]]
Presenting a complex situation as having only two extreme options, ignoring the many healthy middle grounds.

### 5. [[middle-ground|Middle Ground Fallacy]]
Assuming that because two opposing views exist, the correct position must be exactly halfway between them.

### 6. [[post-hoc|Post Hoc Fallacy]]
The assumption that because one event followed another, the first event MUST have caused the second (Correlation vs. Causation).

### 7. [[red-herring|Red Herring]]
Introducing an irrelevant topic to divert attention away from the original issue being debated.

### 8. [[slippery-slope|Slippery Slope]]
Arguing that a small first step will inevitably lead to a chain of catastrophic events without evidence for the link.

### 9. [[straw-man|Straw Man Fallacy]]
Replacing an opponent's actual argument with a distorted or exaggerated version that is much easier to attack.

### 10. [[steel-manning|Steel-Manning]]
*(The Antidote)*: Addressing the strongest possible version of an opponent's argument to ensure a high-quality debate.

### 11. [[tautology|Tautology]]
A statement that is true by its own definition but adds zero new information (e.g., "It is what it is").

### 12. [[tu-quoque|Tu Quoque]]
"You Too!": Deflecting criticism by accusing the critic of being a hypocrite instead of addressing the claim.

### 13. [[whataboutism|Whataboutism]]
A weaponized deflection tactic that ignores criticism by pointing at the faults of others ("But what about them?").
