# Appeal to Authority

Because Dad Said So.

**The Appeal to Authority** (*Argumentum ad Verecundiam*) is a fallacy where you claim something is true *solely* because an "expert" or famous person said it, without offering any actual evidence.

Think of it like **A White Lab Coat**.
*   **The Reality:** Wearing a lab coat doesn't make you right. Even Einstein made math errors. Truth comes from data, not costume.
*   **The Fallacy:** "This toothpaste is the best because Dr. Oz says so." (Is Dr. Oz a dentist? Does he have data? Or is he just famous?)

## How it Works

1.  **Status over Facts:** "Professor X says the earth is flat."
2.  **Irrelevant Expertise:** "My mechanic says vaccines are dangerous." (Mechanics are experts on cars, not immunology).
3.  **Blind Trust:** It shortcuts the need for proof.

## FAQs

*1. Is citing experts bad?*
No! It is *good* to listen to experts. The fallacy is assuming they are *infallible*.
*   **Valid:** "99% of climate scientists agree the earth is warming based on this data." (Consensus + Data).
*   **Fallacy:** "It's true *because* Newton said it." (Newton also believed in Alchemy).

*2. Why do we do it?*
It's a cognitive shortcut. We evolved to trust tribal elders (Heuristics). Verifying everything ourselves is exhausting.
