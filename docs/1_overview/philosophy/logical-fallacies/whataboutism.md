# Whataboutism

But What About Them?

**Whataboutism** is a tactic used to deflect criticism by accusing the critic of the same thing (or something worse), without addressing the original criticism. It is a specific, weaponized version of *[[tu-quoque|Tu Quoque]]*.

Think of it like **The Speeding Ticket**.
*   **The Cop:** "I pulled you over for speeding."
*   **The Driver:** "But what about that guy? He was driving faster than me!"
*   **The Reality:** That guy's speed doesn't make your speed legal. You still broke the law.

## How it Works

1.  **Attack:** "Country A violates human rights."
2.  **Deflection:** "What about Country B? They do it too!"
3.  **Effect:** The conversation shifts to Country B. Country A's crimes are forgotten/normalized.

## FAQs

*1. Is it a fallacy?*
Yes, because it is a *Red Herring*. It changes the subject. It doesn't prove innocence; it just proves shared guilt.

*2. Why is it effective?*
It appeals to our sense of fairness. We hate hypocrisy. But hypocrisy doesn't change facts.
