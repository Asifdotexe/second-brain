# Tu Quoque

You Too!

**Tu Quoque** (Latin for "You also") is a fallacy where you reject an argument because the person making it is a hypocrite, rather than addressing the argument itself. It is a specific type of [[ad-hominem|Ad Hominem]].

Think of it like **The Smoking Doctor**.
*   **The Scenario:** A doctor smokes a pack a day. He tells you: "Smoking is bad for your lungs, here is the data."
*   **The Fallacy:** "You smoke! So your data must be fake."
*   **The Reality:** The doctor is a hypocrite, but his data is still correct.

## How it Works

1.  **Accusation:** "You cheated on your taxes!"
2.  **Reflection:** "Well, you cheated on yours last year!" (Tu Quoque).
3.  **Result:** Now we are arguing about you, not me. The original accusation is ignored.

## FAQs

*1. Does hypocrisy matter?*
For *trust*, yes. For *logic*, no. A thief can correctly say "Stealing is illegal."
