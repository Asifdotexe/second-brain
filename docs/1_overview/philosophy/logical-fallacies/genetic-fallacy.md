# Genetic Fallacy

Judging a beautifully baked cake based entirely on how ugly the kitchen was where it was cooked.

The **Genetic Fallacy** is a logical error where a claim, idea, or argument is accepted or rejected based solely on its origin, history, or source, rather than on its current merit or actual truth.

In logical debates, the *genesis* (origin) of an argument is entirely disconnected from the *validity* of the argument. If a terrible, dishonest person states that 2 + 2 = 4, the math does not become false just because the source is bad. Conversely, if a respected genius proposes a flawed theory, the theory does not become true just because the source is esteemed.

## How it Works

The Genetic Fallacy usually manifests in two ways:

*   **Dismissal by Origin:** "You only believe in human rights because you were raised in a Western democracy, therefore your belief is invalid." (The origin of the belief doesn't make human rights false).
*   **Acceptance by Origin:** "This herbal remedy comes from an ancient, mystical tradition, so it must work." (The ancient origin doesn't prove medical efficacy).

## FAQs

*1. How is this different from an [[ad-hominem|Ad Hominem]] attack?*
[[ad-hominem|Ad Hominem]] specifically attacks the *person* making the argument (e.g., "You're an idiot, so you're wrong"). The Genetic Fallacy attacks the *source or history* of the concept itself (e.g., "That political system was invented by a dictator, so any aspect of it must be evil").

*2. Is the source ever relevant?*
Yes, when establishing *credibility* or *bias* (e.g., a tobacco company releasing a study on lung cancer). However, pointing out a biased source suggests we should scrutinize the data carefully; it does not automatically prove the data itself is factually incorrect.
