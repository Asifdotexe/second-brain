# Slippery Slope

The Snowball Effect.

**The Slippery Slope** is a fallacy where you argue that a relatively small first step will inevitably lead to a chain of related events culminating in some significant (usually negative) effect.

Think of it like **A Slide**.
*   **The Fallacy:** "If I let you have a cookie today, you'll eat cookies every day, get fat, lose your job, and die alone."
*   **The Reality:** Eating one cookie rarely leads to dying alone. There are many stops on the slide where you can get off.

## How it Works

1.  **Step A:** "We should ban automatic assault rifles."
2.  **The Leap:** "If we do that, next they'll ban handguns, then kitchen knives, and soon we'll be living in a tyranny!"
3.  **The Fear:** Focuses on the terrifying *End Result* rather than the actual merit of *Step A*.

## FAQs

*1. Are slopes never slippery?*
Sometimes they are. "If I take heroin once, I might get addicted." That is a valid risk.
*   **Valid Argument:** Proves the causal link between A and B roughly exists.
*   **Fallacy:** Assumes the link is *inevitable* without evidence, usually to fearmonger.
