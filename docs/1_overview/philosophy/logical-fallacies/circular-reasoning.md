# Circular Reasoning

The Snake Eating Its Tail.

**Circular Reasoning** (Begging the Question) is a fallacy where the conclusion is hidden in the premise. You aren't actually proving anything; you are just repeating your assumption in different words.

Think of it like **A Dictionary Loop**.
*   **The Definition:** "A Law is something that is legal."
*   **The Fallacy:** "Why is it illegal? Because it's against the Law."
*   **The Problem:** You haven't explained *why*. You've just run in a circle.

## How it Works

1.  **Premise = Conclusion:** "The Bible is the word of God."
2.  **Proof:** "Because it says so in the Bible."
3.  **Result:** To believe the proof, you must already believe the conclusion. No new information is added.

## FAQs

*1. Is it obvious?*
Rarely. It's usually hidden in complex language. "We must cut spending (Conclusion) because fiscal austerity is necessary (Premise)." Fiscal austerity *means* cutting spending. It sounds smart, but it's a loop.

*2. What is 'Begging the Question'?*
It's the formal name for this. It doesn't mean "Raising the question." It means "Assuming the answer."
