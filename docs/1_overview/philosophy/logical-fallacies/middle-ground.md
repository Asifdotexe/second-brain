# Middle Ground Fallacy

The Truth is in the Middle.

**The Middle Ground Fallacy** (Argumentum ad Temperantiam) is the massive assumption that because two opposing views exist, the correct or honest position *must* be the compromise between them.

Think of it like **Drinking Poison**.
*   **Person A:** "You should drink a gallon of cyanide."
*   **Person B:** "You should drink zero cyanide."
*   **The Fallacy:** "We should compromise and drink half a gallon of cyanide."
*   **The Reality:** Sometimes one side is 100% right and the other is 100% wrong.

## How it Works

1.  **Extremes:** Position A (Sky is Blue) vs Position B (Sky is Yellow).
2.  **Compromise:** Position C (Sky is Green).
3.  **Error:** The sky is actually Blue. The presence of a "Yellow" movement doesn't make the sky Green.

## FAQs

*1. Isn't compromise good?*
Socially, yes. Stick to your guns on *facts*, but compromise on *actions*. "We agree the house is on fire (Fact), but we compromise on using a hose vs a bucket (Action)."
