# Red Herring

Look, a Squirrel!

**A Red Herring** is a fallacy where someone introduces an irrelevant topic to divert attention from the original issue.

Think of it like **Training Dogs**.
*   **The Origin:** Escaped prisoners would supposedly drag a strong-smelling fish (Red Herring) across their trail to confuse the tracking dogs.
*   **The Tactic:** "You asked me about the budget deficit? Let me tell you about how much I love the flag." The flag is the fish. It smells strong (emotional), but it leads nowhere.

## How it Works

1.  **Topic A:** "Did you steal the money?"
2.  **Topic B:** "I have worked at this company for 20 years and I love my coworkers!" (Irrelevant).
3.  **Confusion:** The accuser starts arguing about the coworker love instead of the theft.

## FAQs

*1. Is it the same as [[straw-man|Straw Man]]?*
No.
*   **Straw Man:** Twists your *actual* argument.
*   **Red Herring:** Changes the subject entirely.
