# The Burden of Proof

Telling a judge someone is guilty of a crime and then demanding the defendant prove they *didn't* do it.

**The Burden of Proof** (Onus Probandi) is the logical obligation that the person making a claim is the one responsible for providing the evidence to support it. The burden never lies with the person questioning or denying the claim.

In any debate or scientific inquiry, the default state of the universe is the negative (the *null hypothesis*). If you propose that a new phenomenon exists; whether it's a new law of physics, a conspiracy theory, or a literal teapot orbiting Mars; you must bring the data. You cannot make a claim and then declare it true simply because your opponent cannot definitively prove it false.

## How it Works

*   **Shifting the Burden:** A common debate tactic is attempting to shift the burden of proof. E.g., Person A says, "Aliens built the pyramids." Person B says, "I don't believe that." Person A replies, "Well, prove they didn't!" This is a logical fallacy.
*   **The Null Hypothesis:** In science, we assume there is no relationship or no new entity until proven otherwise. We don't assume a new drug cures cancer until proven useless; we assume it is useless until proven it cures cancer.
*   **Hitchens's Razor:** Coined by journalist Christopher Hitchens: *"What can be asserted without evidence can also be dismissed without evidence."*

## FAQs

*1. Does "absence of evidence" equal "evidence of absence"?*
No. Just because we don't have evidence of alien life right now doesn't mean alien life physically does not exist. It just means the *claim* "aliens exist" cannot currently be accepted as proven fact.

*2. Who has the burden when both sides make a claim?*
Both sides. If Person A claims "The economy will crash tomorrow" and Person B claims "The economy will boom tomorrow," both have made positive assertions and both must bring evidence.
