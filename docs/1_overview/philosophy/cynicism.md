# Cynicism

Living like a dog to be truly free.

Modern usage suggests a "Cynic" is someone who assumes people are selfish.
**Ancient Cynicism** was a philosophy of rejecting all social conventions (money, fame, power, manners) to live in accordance with nature.

The word comes from *Kyon*, meaning "Dog." The goal was to be as shameless, happy, and free as a stray dog.

## The Diogenes Story

Diogenes (the most famous Cynic) lived in a ceramic tub on the streets of Athens.
*   He owned nothing but a wooden bowl (until he saw a boy drink from his hands, then smashed the bowl because it was "unnecessary baggage").
*   When Alexander the Great (the most powerful man in the world) asked if he could do anything for Diogenes, he replied: *"Yes, move. You are blocking my sunlight."*

## FAQs

*1. What is the core lesson?*
Happiness comes from **Self-Sufficiency**. If you need nothing (no big house, no applause, no fancy clothes), nothing can be taken away from you. You are invincible.

*2. Is it practical today?*
You don't have to live in a tub. But you can practice it by:
*   Not caring what people think of you.
*   Realizing you don't *need* the new iPhone to be happy.
*   Living simply.
