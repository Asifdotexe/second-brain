# Fermi Paradox

The silence is deafening.

**The Fermi Paradox** is the contradiction between the high statistical probability that extraterrestrial civilizations exist and the complete lack of evidence for them.

The universe is old (13.8 billion years) and huge ($10^{22}$ stars). Even if life is one-in-a-billion rare, there should be millions of civilizations. Some should be millions of years older than us, capable of colonizing the galaxy.
So, as physicist Enrico Fermi famously asked: **"Where is everybody?"**

## The Great Filter
One proposed solution is that there is a barrier to life's development that is extremely hard to cross.
*   **Scenario A (Optimistic):** We are special. The filter is *behind* us (e.g., jump from single-cell to multi-cell life is rare). We made it!
*   **Scenario B (Pessimistic):** We are doomed. The filter is *ahead* of us. Advanced civilizations inevitably destroy themselves (nukes, AI, climate) before they can spread.

## FAQs

*1. Maybe they are hiding?*
This is the "Dark Forest" theory. It suggests the universe is like a dark forest full of hunters. If you shout (send radio signals), you get eaten. Therefore, every smart civilization stays quiet. We are the only idiots shouting "Hello!"

*2. Are we just too early?*
Possibly. The universe was too hot/chaotic for life for billions of years. We might be the "Elder Race"; the first ones to wake up.
