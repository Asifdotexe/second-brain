# Ship of Theseus

The grandfather's axe problem: same handle, new head.

**The Ship of Theseus** is a thought experiment that asks: if an object has had all of its components replaced, does it remain the same object?

Imagine a famous wooden ship docked in a museum. Over 100 years, every rotting plank, mast, and nail is replaced with a new one. Is it still the "Ship of Theseus"?
Now, imagine someone took all the *old* rotting planks and built a second ship in the backyard. Which one is the "real" ship? The one with the history (the new parts), or the one with the original matter (the rotting parts)?

## The Core Conflict
It challenges our definition of **Identity**:
*   **Materialism:** You are your atoms. (Verdict: Rotting ship is real).
*   **Functionalism/Continuity:** You are your pattern/history. (Verdict: Museum ship is real).

## FAQs

*1. Does this apply to humans?*
Yes. Your cells regenerate constantly. You are not made of the same "stuff" you were 10 years ago. Are you the same person? Using the "Continuity" theory, yes, because the *pattern* of you survived the transition.

*2. Why does it matter?*
It affects **Teletransportation** theory (Star Trek). If a transporter disassembles your atoms and reassembles them on Mars with new atoms, did you move, or did you die and a clone take your place?
