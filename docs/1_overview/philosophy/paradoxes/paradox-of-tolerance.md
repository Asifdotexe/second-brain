# Paradox of Tolerance

Should a tolerant society tolerate intolerance?

**The Paradox of Tolerance** states that if a society is tolerant without limit, its ability to be tolerant will eventually be seized or destroyed by the intolerant.

Imagine a garden where you allow *everything* to grow because you are a "tolerant" gardener. Eventually, aggressive weeds (intolerance) will eagerly choke out the flowers (tolerance). To keep the garden tolerant of flowers, you must be *intolerant* of the weeds.
Popper argued that to maintain a tolerant society, the society must be intolerant of intolerance.

## The Fine Print
Popper didn't say "ban all ideas you dislike."
He specified: *Do not suppress intolerant philosophies as long as we can counter them by rational argument and keep them in check by public opinion.*
Suppression is the last resort, used only when a group refuses to debate and answers arguments with fists or guns.

## FAQs

*1. Is this a license to be mean?*
No. It is a preservation instinct for democracy. It distinguishes between "disagreement" (I think your tax plan is wrong) and "existential threat" (I think you shouldn't exist).

*2. Who decides what is "intolerant"?*
That is the hard part. The paradox warns us of the danger, but it doesn't give us a clear ruler to measure it. It's a constant balancing act for free speech.
