# Bootstrap Paradox

Who wrote the book?

**The Bootstrap Paradox** (or Causal Loop) is a theoretical paradox in time travel where an object or piece of information exists without ever having been created.

Imagine you adore Beethoven. You build a time machine and travel back to meet him, but you find he doesn't exist. Desperate to preserve the music, you write down all his symphonies (which you memorized) and publish them under his name.
**The Conflict:** You copied the music from him (in the future). He copied the music from you (in the past). *Who actually wrote the music?* It has no origin. It just exists in an infinite loop.

## The Problem with "Origin"
In our linear understanding of time, everything must have a **cause**. A painting needs a painter; a book needs an author.
In a bootstrap loop, the object is "self-created" (it pulls itself up by its own bootstraps). It violates the Law of Causality (Cause $\rightarrow$ Effect).

## FAQs

*1. Is this the same as the [[grandfather-paradox|Grandfather Paradox]]?*
No. The [[grandfather-paradox|Grandfather Paradox]] is a **destructive** loop (you stop yourself from existing). The Bootstrap Paradox is a **constructive** loop (the loop is stable and self-reinforcing).

*2. Where did the name come from?*
From the phrase "pulling yourself up by your bootstraps" and popularized by the Robert Heinlein story *By His Bootstraps*.
