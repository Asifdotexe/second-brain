# Grandfather Paradox

The error message of the universe.

**The Grandfather Paradox** is a logical contradiction in time travel: if you travel back in time and change the past, you might eliminate the cause of your own travel.

The classic scenario: You build a time machine, go back to 1920, and kill your grandfather before he meets your grandmother.
*   **Result A:** You are never born.
*   **Result B:** If you are never born, you never built the time machine.
*   **Result C:** If you never built the machine, you didn't kill him.
*   **Result D:** So you *are* born, and you kill him. (Loop).

## Proposed Solutions
Physicists and Philosophers have tried to "patch" this bug:

1.  **Multiverse Theory:** You didn't kill *your* grandfather; you created a branched timeline where a version of him died. You can never return to your original future.
2.  **Novikov Self-Consistency Principle:** The universe effectively "autocorrects." The gun will jam, you'll miss, or you'll accidentally *cause* them to meet. You cannot change what has already happened.

## FAQs

*1. Is time travel actually possible?*
Forward? Yes (Relativity says go fast, time slows down). Backward? Maybe not. Some physicists argue that this paradox proves backward time travel is impossible because the universe cannot process a logic error.
