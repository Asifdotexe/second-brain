# Paradox

A truth that sounds like a lie.

A **Paradox** is a statement that contradicts itself on the surface, but upon deeper reflection, reveals a truth (or exposes a flaw in our logic).

It breaks your brain's autopilot and forces you to think.

## The Catalog of Paradoxes

Below is a collection of thought experiments and logical contradictions that challenge our understanding of reality, time, and consciousness.

### 1. [[bootstrap-paradox|The Bootstrap Paradox]]
A causal loop where an object or information exists without ever being created. (Example: An author who copies their own book from the future).

### 2. [[chinese-room|The Chinese Room]]
Argues that AI might simulate understanding through rules (syntax) but lacks true consciousness or meaning (semantics).

### 3. [[fermi-paradox|The Fermi Paradox]]
The unsettling contradiction between the high statistical likelihood of alien life and the fact that we have never heard from anyone.

### 4. [[grandfather-paradox|The Grandfather Paradox]]
The classic time-travel glitch: if you kill your own grandfather, you prevent your own birth, which prevents you from ever traveling back to kill him.

### 5. [[paradox-of-tolerance|The Paradox of Tolerance]]
States that for a society to remain tolerant, it must be intolerant of intolerance, otherwise the intolerant will destroy the system.

### 6. [[ship-of-theseus|The Ship of Theseus]]
If every single plank of a ship is replaced over time, is it still the same ship? A fundamental question on the nature of identity.

## FAQs

*1. Why do philosophers love them?*
They act as "Stress Tests" for our definitions. We think we know what "Same" means, until the Ship of Theseus proves we don't.
