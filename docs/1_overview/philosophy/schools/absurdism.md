# Absurdism

Laughing at the silence of the universe.

Humans have an innate drive to find meaning and order. The Universe is chaotic and silent. **Absurdism** is the conflict between the two. It says: "Life is meaningless, but we should live it anyway."

It doesn't say "Give up" ([[nihilism|Nihilism]]) or "Create your own meaning" ([[existentialism|Existentialism]]). It says "Embrace the absurdity and rebel by being happy."

## The Myth of Sisyphus

Albert Camus used the Greek myth of Sisyphus to explain this.
*   **The Punishment:** Sisyphus pushes a boulder up a hill, only to watch it roll back down, forever.
*   **The Absurdity:** It is pointless work.
*   **The Victory:** If Sisyphus *accepts* his fate and finds joy in the struggle itself, he defeats the punishment. "One must imagine Sisyphus happy."

## FAQs

*1. Is it the same as Nihilism?*
No.
*   **Nihilist:** "Nothing matters, so why bother?" (Despair).
*   **Absurdist:** "Nothing matters, so let's go get ice cream!" (Freedom).

*2. How do I practice it?*
Stop looking for a "Grand Purpose." Enjoy your coffee. Laugh at bad luck. Realize that because there is no cosmic scorecard, you are free to just *be*.
