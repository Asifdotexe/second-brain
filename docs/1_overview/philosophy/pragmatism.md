# Pragmatism

If it works, it's true.

Most philosophy asks: "Is this theory inherently true?"
**Pragmatism** asks: "Does believing this theory actually help us?"

It treats beliefs like tools. A hammer isn't "True" or "False"; it is "Useful" or "Useless."

## The Cash Value of Truth

William James (a father of Pragmatism) said we should look for the **"Cash Value"** of an idea.
*   *Example:* "Do we have Free Will?"
    *   **Metaphysics:** Let's debate for 2,000 years.
    *   **Pragmatism:** If I believe I have free will, I act better and improve my life. If I believe I am a robot, I get lazy. Therefore, acting *as if* I have free will is the "True" choice.

## FAQs

*1. Is it just "The ends justify the means"?*
No. That is [[machiavellianism|Machiavellianism]].
Pragmatism is about testing Truth by its consequences. If a belief makes you miserable and passive, it is a "bad" belief, even if it seems logically sound.

*2. Is it anti-science?*
No, Science *is* pragmatic! Scientists don't say "Gravity is the absolute final truth." They say "Gravity is the best model we have right now that allows us to build bridges that don't fall down."
