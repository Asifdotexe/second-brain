# HIPAA

Protecting the most sensitive data: your health.

**HIPAA** is a U.S. federal law that created national standards to protect sensitive patient health information from being disclosed without the patient's consent or knowledge.

## The Three Main Rules
To be HIPAA compliant, organizations must follow three specific sets of rules:

1.  **The Privacy Rule**: Sets standards for when **Protected Health Information (PHI)** can be used or shared.
2.  **The Security Rule**: Sets standards for the technical safeguards (like [[encryption|encryption]] and firewalls) that must be in place to protect *digital* PHI.
3.  **The Breach Notification Rule**: Requires organizations to notify patients and the government if their health data is breached.

## Protected Health Information (PHI)
This includes any information that identifies an individual and relates to:
*   The individual’s past, present, or future physical or mental health.
*   The provision of healthcare to the individual.
*   The past, present, or future payment for the provision of healthcare.

### HITRUST
Because HIPAA is a law (high-level) and not a technical checklist, many organizations use the **HITRUST (Health Information Trust Alliance)** framework to help them prove they are actually meeting HIPAA requirements.
