# GDPR

The global standard for privacy.

The **GDPR** is a regulation in EU law on data protection and privacy in the European Union and the European Economic Area. Since it took effect in 2018, it has become the "Gold Standard" for privacy laws worldwide.

## Key Tenets
1.  **Scope**: It protects the personal data of all EU residents. Even if a company is based in the U.S. or Asia, if they have an EU customer, they must follow GDPR.
2.  **Consent**: Companies must get clear, affirmative consent before collecting data. They can't hide it in 50 pages of legal text.
3.  **Right to Access/Erasure**: Users have the right to ask a company "What data do you have on me?" and the right to be "forgotten" (asking the company to delete their data).
4.  **Breach Notification**: If a company is hacked, they MUST notify the authorities within **72 hours** of becoming aware of the breach.

## Consequences
*   **Heavy Fines**: Non-compliance can lead to massive fines; up to 4% of a company's total global turnover or €20 million (whichever is higher).

### What is "Personal Data"?
Under GDPR, this includes anything that can identify a specific person:
*   Names and addresses.
*   Email addresses.
*   IP addresses.
*   Biometric data (fingerprints, facial recognition).
