# Security Ethics and Privacy

The moral compass of digital defense.

**Security Ethics** are guidelines for making appropriate decisions as a security professional. Being ethical requires remaining unbiased and maintaining the confidentiality of the private data you are trusted to protect.

## Core Ethical Obligations
As a security professional, you hold an ethical obligation to:
1.  **Protect the Organization**: Secure the infrastructure and the people involved.
2.  **Remain Unbiased**: Conduct work honestly and rely on evidence, not assumptions.
3.  **Respect the Law**: Conduct work with the highest respect for legal boundaries.
4.  **Continuous Learning**: Stay informed about evolving threats to better protect the digital landscape.

## Privacy Protection (PII and SPII)
Safeguarding personal information is a primary ethical duty.
*   **PII (Personally Identifiable Information)**: Any data that can identify an individual (e.g., name, phone number).
*   **SPII (Sensitive PII)**: A specific type of PII that falls under stricter handling guidelines because it can cause significant harm if stolen (e.g., Social Security Numbers, credit card numbers).

## International Rules for Counterattacks
Digital warfare has rules. According to the **International Court of Justice (ICJ)**, a person or group can only counterattack if:
1.  **Targeting**: The counterattack only affects the party that attacked first.
2.  **Communication**: It is part of a direct communication asking the attacker to stop.
3.  **Proportionality**: It does not escalate the situation.
4.  **Reversibility**: The effects of the counterattack can be reversed.

### Key Reminder
Ethics and laws are the foundation that prevents a security professional from becoming a threat actor. Transparency, honesty, and a commitment to the "betterment of the cyber landscape" are essential traits.
