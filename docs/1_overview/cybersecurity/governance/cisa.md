# Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA)

The United States federal agency responsible for protecting the nation's critical infrastructure from physical and cyber threats.

Think of CISA as the "nation's risk advisor," working with both government and private industry to defend against hackers, particularly state-sponsored actors.

## Key Responsibilities

- **Critical Infrastructure Protection**: Securing power grids, water systems, and financial networks.
- **Vulnerability Management**: Issuing alerts about actively exploited flaws (via the **Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (KEV) Catalog**).
- **Incident Coordination**: Leading the national response to major cyber incidents.
- **Directives**: Issuing Binding Operational Directives (BODs) that order federal agencies to patch critical security holes (e.g., [[zero-day]] exploits).

## Important Standards & Catalogues
- **[[cve|CVE]] Monitoring**: Tracking common vulnerabilities and exposures.
- **KEV Catalog**: A list of vulnerabilities that have been confirmed as being used in real-world attacks.
