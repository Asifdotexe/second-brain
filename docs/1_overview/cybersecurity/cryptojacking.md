# Cyptojacking

A digital parasite that secretly steals your computer's electricity and brainpower to make money for a hacker.

It is the unauthorized use of someone else’s computer to "mine" cryptocurrency. 

Instead of stealing your personal data (like passwords or photos), the hacker is stealing your **resources**. They install a hidden program on your device (or hide it in a website you visit) that forces your computer to solve complex math problems. These solutions generate digital money, which goes straight to the hacker's wallet, while you are left with a slow computer and a high electricity bill.

## FAQs

*1. How does it get on my computer?*

There are two main ways:
*  **Browser-Based (Drive-by):** You visit a shady website (streaming or gambling sites). A script runs in the background of that web page. As long as the tab is open, your computer mines for them.
*  **Malware-Based:** You download a file (like a "free" game crack or software). The mining program installs itself deeper in your system and runs every time you turn the computer on.

*2. How do I know if I'm infected?*

Cryptojacking is designed to be quiet, but look for these signs:
* **The Fan Test:** Your laptop fans are spinning at max speed even when you are just reading text.
* **Slowness:** Your computer feels laggy or freezes during simple tasks.
* **Battery Drain:** Your phone or laptop battery dies much faster than usual.
* **The Task Manager:** Open your Task Manager (Windows) or Activity Monitor (Mac). If you see "CPU Usage" at 90-100% caused by a browser or a weirdly named file, that's a red flag.
