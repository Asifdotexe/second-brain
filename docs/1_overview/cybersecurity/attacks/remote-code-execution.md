# Remote Code Execution (RCE)

**Remote Code Execution (RCE)** is a type of vulnerability that allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on a victim's machine without having to physically access it through the network.

This is often used to run malicious code on the remote system, this can lead to bad actor(s)
- getting inside your system
- getting access to sensitive data
- getting access to your system's resources for malicious activities like [[botnet|Botnet-Attacks]], [[cryptojacking|Cryptojacking]]
- can lock your system in demand to extort money from you or your organization ([[ransomware|Ransomware]]).
  
### These can be of few different types:
- Injection attacks: Applications and sites that take in user input, deliberately providing arbitrary code that would be executed by the Application or the site, example: SQL Injection, [[command-injection|Command Injection]] and XSS etc.
