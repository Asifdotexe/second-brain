# Cybersecurity Attacks

The arsenal of the digital adversary.

Cybersecurity attacks range from simple social engineering tricks to complex, automated [[malware|malware]] that can paralyze global infrastructure. This catalogue provides a summary of the various attack vectors, malicious software, and vulnerabilities documented in this knowledge bank.

## The Catalog of Attacks

### 1. [[malware|Malware]] (Overview)
A broad category of malicious software; including viruses, [[worms|worms]], and [[ransomware|ransomware]]; designed specifically to harm systems, steal data, or gain unauthorized access.

### 2. [[phishing|Phishing]]
Social engineering that uses deceptive emails or messages to trick users into revealing passwords, credit card numbers, or other sensitive information.

### 3. [[vishing|Vishing]]
"Voice [[phishing|Phishing]]": Scammers use phone calls to create a sense of urgency and trick victims into granting remote access or transferring money.

### 4. [[ransomware|Ransomware]]
Digital kidnapping: [[malware|Malware]] that encrypts your files and demands a ransom (usually in Bitcoin) in exchange for the decryption key.

### 5. [[wipers|Wipers]]
The "digital shredder": Destructive [[malware|malware]] used in [[cyber-warfare|cyber warfare]] to permanently erase data from hard drives with no intention of recovery.

### 6. [[worms|Worms]]
Standalone [[malware|malware]] that spreads automatically across networks without needing a host program or any human action.

### 7. [[virus|Computer Virus]]
A classic infection that attaches itself to a host program or file and replicates by infecting other files when the host is executed.

### 8. [[trojan|Trojan Horse]]
Malicious software that disguises itself as something useful (like a free game or tool) to trick you into inviting it into your system.

### 9. [[botnets|Botnets]]
An army of "zombie" computers (infected devices) secretly controlled by a hacker to launch massive attacks like [[ddos|DDoS]] or crypto mining.

### 10. [[ddos|DDoS]] (Distributed Denial of Service)
A "digital traffic jam": Overwhelming a website or server with a flood of traffic from a [[botnets|botnet]] to make it crash or become unreachable.

### 11. [[cryptojacking|Cryptojacking]]
A digital parasite that secretly uses your computer's processing power and electricity to mine cryptocurrency for a hacker.

### 12. [[key-loggers|Keyloggers]]
Surveillance tools (hardware or software) that secretly record everything you type to steal passwords and personal messages.

### 13. [[spywares|Spyware]]
Broad category of surveillance [[malware|malware]] that quietly tracks your activities and steals information while remaining as invisible as possible.

### 14. [[rootkit|Rootkit]]
Stealthy toolsets that give a hacker deep administrative control over a computer while hiding their presence from the [[operating-system|operating system]].

### 15. [[logic-bomb|Logic Bomb]]
Malicious code that sits dormant and "explodes" (triggers) only when a specific condition is met, such as a date or a specific event.

### 16. [[supply-chain-attack|Supply Chain Attack]]
Attacking a large organization by first compromising the smaller, less-secure vendors or suppliers that they trust.

### 17. [[zero-day|Zero-Day]]
An attack that exploits a previously unknown software flaw before the developers have had "zero days" to create a fix or patch.

### 18. [[remote-code-execution|Remote Code Execution]] (RCE)
The "Holy Grail" for hackers: A vulnerability that allows them to run their own code on a remote server from anywhere in the world.

### 19. [[command-injection|Command Injection]]
Tricking a system into obeying unauthorized commands by hiding them in legitimate-looking input fields (like a search bar).

### 20. [[react2shell|React2Shell]]
A critical vulnerability (CVE-2025-55182) that allows hackers to take control of servers running specific versions of React Server Components.

### 21. [[doxing|Doxing]]
A real-world threat: Publicly revealing someone's private identifying information online to enable harassment or physical threats.

### 22. [[adware|Adware]]
Unwanted software that bombards you with advertisements, often tracking your browsing habits to sell your data to advertisers.
