# Trojan Horse

The gift that eats you.

A **Trojan Horse** is a type of malware that disguises itself as legitimate software.
It is named after the Greek story of the wooden horse used to trick the defenders of Troy.

## How it works
1.  **Deception:** You think you are downloading a "Free Minecraft Screen Recorder."
2.  **Infection:** You run it. It might even actually record your screen.
3.  **Payload:** In the background, it opens a backdoor for a hacker to control your PC.

## FAQs

*1. Does it replicate?*
No. Unlike a worm or virus, a Trojan does not copy itself. It relies on **You** to download and run it.
