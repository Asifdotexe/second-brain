# Keylogger

The digital spy looking over your shoulder.

A **Keylogger** (Keystroke Logger) is a surveillance tool that records every single keystroke you make on your computer.

It captures passwords, credit card numbers, personal emails, and chat logs. It can be software (a hidden program) or hardware (a physical plug inserted between the keyboard and the computer).

## How it works

1.  **Infection:** You accidentally download it (via [[phishing]] or infected USB).
2.  **Recording:** It silently writes `USER: typed 'facebook.com', then typed 'MyPassword123'` to a hidden text file.
3.  **Exfiltration:** It secretly emails that text file to the hacker.

## FAQs

*1. Can [[antivirus]] detect it?*
Software keyloggers: Yes, usually.
Hardware keyloggers: No, because they live outside the [[operating-system]]. You have to physically check your keyboard cable.
