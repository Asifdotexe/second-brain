# WannaCry

The epidemic that held the world hostage.

**WannaCry** (2017) was a global **[[ransomware|Ransomware]]** attack that infected over 200,000 computers in 150 countries within a single weekend.

It was the first time a criminal ransomware used a military-grade weapon (the **[[eternalblue|EternalBlue]]** exploit) to spread automatically. It didn't wait for you to click an email; if your computer was connected to the internet and unpatched, it just *happened*.

## The Damage

*   **NHS (UK Hospitals):** The biggest tragedy. It shut down X-ray machines, ambulances were diverted, and surgeries were cancelled. Lives were put at risk.
*   **Telefónica (Spain):** The telecom giant was paralyzed.
*   **FedEx & Renault:** Factories stopped production.

## FAQs

*1. How was it stopped?*
By accident. A 22-year-old security researcher named **Marcus Hutchins** found a \"Kill Switch\" in the code.
The virus checked if a specific (gibberish) website existed before attacking. If the website existed, the virus stopped. Marcus bought the domain for $10, and the entire global attack instantly shut down.

*2. Did people pay?*
Surprisingly, not much. The hackers made only about $140,000 total. The chaos cost the world nearly **$4 billion** in damages, but the criminals failed to cash in efficiently.
