# Ransomware

Digital kidnapping of your files.

**Ransomware** is a specific type of [[malware]] that locks (encrypts) your computer or files so you cannot access them. The attacker then demands a "ransom" (usually in Bitcoin) to give you the key to unlock them.

Imagine coming home, but your key doesn't work, and there is a note on the door saying: *"Pay $1000 to get your new key, or we burn the house down."*

## How it Works

1.  **Infection:** You download a bad file or click a bad link.
2.  **Encryption:** The [[malware|malware]] quietly scrambles your photos, documents, and databases.
3.  **The Note:** A pop-up screen appears with a countdown timer and payment instructions.
4.  **Extortion:** If you don't pay, you lose the data forever. Sometimes, they also threaten to *leak* your private data to the public (Double Extortion).

## FAQs

*1. Should I pay the ransom?*
**No.** (According to the FBI and experts).
*   There is no guarantee they will actually unlock your files.
*   It funds their operations and encourages them to attack others.
*   You serve as a "paying customer" target for future attacks.

*2. How do I protect myself?*
The only 100% cure is **Backups**.
If you have a backup of your files on an external [[hard-drive|hard drive]] that wasn't plugged in during the attack, you can just wipe your computer and restore your files. You lose nothing but time.
