# Computer Worm

The traveler.

A **Worm** is a standalone malware program that replicates itself to spread to other computers.
Crucially, it does **not** need a host file (like a [[virus]]) and does **not** need human interaction (like a [[trojan|Trojan]]).

It scans the network, finds a vulnerability, and copies itself over.

## The Morris Worm (1988)

The first internet worm. Robert Morris wrote it to gauge the size of the internet. A coding error made it replicate too fast, crashing 10% of the entire internet in days.

## FAQs

*1. What makes them dangerous?*
Speed. A worm can infect millions of computers in hours because it spreads automatically. [[ransomware|Ransomware]] like **[[wanna-cry|WannaCry]]** was so devastating because it included a "Worm" component ([[eternalblue|EternalBlue]]) to spread without users clicking anything.
