# Vishing

The scammer who talks you into unlocking the door.

**Vishing** (Voice Phishing) is a social engineering attack where fraudsters use phone calls; often with fake caller IDs; to trick you into revealing sensitive information or transferring money.

Think of it like a con artist wearing a fake uniform. In email [[phishing|phishing]], they send a fake letter. In vishing, they actually call you, pretending to be someone you trust (like your bank or Amazon support) to create a false sense of urgency or authority. Because you hear a human voice, it can feel more "real" and harder to ignore than an email.

## How it Works

*   **Spoofing:** Scammers use software to make their phone number look like it's coming from a legitimate organization (e.g., "Chase Bank" or a local area code).
*   **The Script:** They follow a prepared script designed to trigger emotion; fear ("Your account is compromised!") or excitement ("You won a cruise!").
*   **The Ask:** The goal is always the same: get you to verify your identity (give up your SSN), fix a "[[virus|virus]]" (grant remote access), or stop a "fraudulent charge" (send them money).

## FAQs

*1. How can I tell if a call is fake?*
Legitimate organizations will **never** call you and ask for your password, PIN, or 2FA code. If they pressure you to act *immediately*, it’s a scam. Hang up and call the official number on the back of your card.

*2. Why did the caller ID say "IRS"?*
Caller ID is easily faked (spoofed). Do not trust the name or number on your screen.
