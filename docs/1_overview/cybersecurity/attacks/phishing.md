# Phishing

Hacking the human, not the machine.

**Phishing** is a type of cyber attack where scammers pretend to be a trustworthy entity (like your bank, Netflix, or your boss) to trick you into revealing sensitive information.

Instead of writing complex code to break your password, they just *ask* you for it.

## The Hook

Phishing works on three principles:
1.  **Urgency:** "Act now or your account will be deleted!" (Makes you panic).
2.  **Authority:** "This is the IRS." (Makes you obey).
3.  **Curiosity:** "Look at these photos of you!" (Makes you click).

## Common Types

*   **Email Phishing:** The classic "You won the lottery" emails.
*   **Spear Phishing:** A highly targeted attack customized for *you* (e.g., mentioning your specific job title or friends).
*   **Whaling:** Targeting high-profile targets like CEOs or CFOs.
*   **Vishing:** Phishing over the phone ("Voice Phishing").
*   **Smishing:** Phishing via SMS text messages.

## FAQs

*1. How do I spot a phishing email?*
*   **Check the Sender:** Does the email come from `support@amazon-security-update.com` instead of `amazon.com`?
*   **Hover over Links:** Don't click. Hover your mouse over the button. Does it go to a weird website?
*   **Generic Greetings:** "Dear Customer" instead of your name.
*   **Bad Grammar:** Legitimate companies have editors; scammers often don't.

*2. What do I do if I clicked?*
*   **Disconnect:** Turn off your internet to stop any [[malware|malware]] from downloading.
*   **Change Passwords:** Immediately change your passwords (from a different device if possible).
*   **Report it:** Tell your IT team or the company being impersonated.
