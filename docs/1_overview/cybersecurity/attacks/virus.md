# Computer Virus

The biological flu for computers.

A **Virus** is a specific type of malware that requires a **Host Program** to survive. It attaches its malicious code to a clean file (like `game.exe`). When you run the game, the virus runs first, infects other files on your computer, and then runs the game.

## Virus vs. Malware

People use "Virus" to mean everything bad.
*   *Correct:* All Viruses are Malware.
*   *Incorrect:* All Malware are Viruses. (Worms and Trojans are not viruses because they don't attach to hosts).

## FAQs

*1. Do viruses still exist?*
They are actually rare today. Modern hackers prefer [[ransomware]] (for money) or [[botnets]] (for power). "Old school" file-infecting viruses are less profitable.
