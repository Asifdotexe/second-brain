# Doxing

The Weaponized Resume.

**Doxing** (dropping "docs" or documents) is the act of publicly revealing previously private personal information about an individual or organization, usually through the internet.

Think of it like **Unmasking a Superhero**.
*   **Anonymity:** You interact with "Batman" (an anonymous username). You judge them by their actions.
*   **Doxing:** Someone finds out Batman is Bruce Wayne, lives at 1007 Mountain Drive, and works at Wayne Enterprises. They print this on flyers and drop them all over Gotham.
Now, the mob knows where he lives, where he works, and who his family is. The digital fight becomes a real-life threat.

## How it Works

1.  **Reconnaissance:** Hackers (or just patient stalkers) search for breadcrumbs.
    *   Old forum posts using the same username.
    *   Whois records for websites you own.
    *   Metadata in photos posted to social media.
2.  **Aggregation:** They piece together the puzzle: "UsernameX" -> "Real Name" -> "Home Address".
3.  **The Drop:** They publish the dossier on a public forum (Twitter, 4chan, etc.).
4.  **Harassment:** The mob uses this info to harass the victim IRL (swatting, pizza bombs, employment threats).

## FAQs

*1. Is it illegal?*
Technically, often no. If the information was found in "publicly available" sources (like phone books or public social profiles), compiling it isn't always a crime. However, used for harassment or stalking, it *becomes* illegal.

*2. How can I protect myself?*
Practice "Data Hygiene." Use different usernames for different sites. Don't post photos of your house or workplace. Scrub your data from "People Search" sites.
