# NotPetya

A disguised assassin pretending to be a kidnapper.

**NotPetya** (2017) was a devastating cyberattack that looked like [[ransomware|Ransomware]] but was actually a **[[wipers|Wiper]]**.

Ransomware locks your files and asks for money to unlock them. NotPetya locked the files, asked for money, but **deleted the key**. Even if you paid, you could never get your data back. Its goal wasn't money; it was pure destruction.

## The Target

It was a targeted attack against **Ukraine** by Russian military hackers (Sandworm).
*   They hacked a popular Ukrainian accounting software (**M.E.Doc**) that every business used to pay taxes.
*   They pushed a malicious \"Update\" to everyone.
*   Boom. Banks, airports, and power companies in Ukraine went dark.
*   *Collateral Damage:* It spread globally (via [[eternalblue|EternalBlue]]), costing companies like Maersk and FedEx over **$10 billion**.

## FAQs

*1. Why call it \"NotPetya\"?*
When it first appeared, it looked exactly like an older criminal ransomware called \"Petya.\" Security researchers said, \"Oh, it's Petya again.\"
Then they realized the code was different and purely destructive. So they named it \"Not-Petya.\"

*2. What did we learn?*
It showed the danger of **[[supply-chain-attack|Supply Chain Attacks]]**. You can have the best firewall in the world, but if the software you *trust* (like your accounting app) sends you a virus, you let it right in.
