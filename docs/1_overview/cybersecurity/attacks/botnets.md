# Botnet

Imagine an army of computers, secretly controlled by one person to attack a specific target.

A **Botnet** (short for "Robot Network") is a collection of internet-connected devices, like laptops, smartphones, or even smart fridges, that have been infected with malicious software.

This software runs quietly in the background without the owner knowing. It connects the device to a central "Command & Control" server, allowing a hacker to control thousands of these devices at once to perform massive attacks.

## FAQs

*1. Why do hackers use Botnets?*
Hackers rarely use botnets just for fun. They are usually financially motivated:
* **DDoS Attacks:** They threaten to crash a company's website unless the company pays a ransom.
* **Spam:** They use the army to send millions of spam emails (so their own computer doesn't get blocked).
* **Crypto Mining:** They use the tiny bit of electricity from thousands of computers to mine Bitcoin or Monero for themselves.

*2. Am I part of a Botnet?*
You might be if:
* Your computer fans are running loud when you aren't doing anything heavy.
* Your internet is weirdly slow.
* Friends tell you they received strange emails from you.
