# Logic Bomb

The time bomb.

A **Logic Bomb** is a piece of malicious code intentionally inserted into a software system that will "explode" (execute a harmful function) only when specific conditions are met.

Unlike other [[malware]], it lies dormant (sleeping) until the trigger happens.

## Triggers

*   **Time:** Explode on Friday the 13th.
*   **Event:** Explode if the database reaches 1000 users.
*   **Absence (Dead Man's Switch):** Explode if the creator is fired (e.g., if the admin doesn't log in for 7 days, wipe the servers).

## FAQs

*1. Who uses them?*
Mostly **Insiders** (disgruntled employees). Since you need access to the code to plant the bomb, it's rarely used by random external hackers.
