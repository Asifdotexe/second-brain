# Cyber Warfare

War without soldiers, fought with code instead of bullets.

**Cyber Warfare** is the use of digital attacks by one country (or nation-state) to damage, disrupt, or spy on another country.

It isn't about stealing credit cards (Cyber Crime) or defacing websites ([[hactivism|Hacktivism]]). It is about **Strategic Destruction**. Just as an air force bombs a bridge to stop enemy tanks, a Cyber Army hacks a power grid to turn off the enemy's lights.

## Key Targets

*   **Critical Infrastructure:** Shutting down power plants, water treatment facilities, or hospitals (to cause panic).
*   **Financial Systems:** Wiping banking data to destroy an economy.
*   **Military Systems:** Jamming communications so commanders can't talk to soldiers.

## FAQs

*1. Is it a real war?*
Legally, it is a gray area. If a hacker turns off the power in a hospital and people die, is that an act of war? Most nations now say **Yes**, and reserve the right to respond with *actual* missiles.

*2. Who are the big players?*
The usual superpowers. **US, China, Russia, Israel, Iran, and North Korea** all have dedicated military units for cyber operations.
