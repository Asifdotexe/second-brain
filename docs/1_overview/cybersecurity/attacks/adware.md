# Adware

The salesperson who won't leave your house.

**Adware** (Advertising-Supported Software) is software that automatically displays or downloads advertising material (often banners or pop-ups) when a user is online.

While not always "malicious" (some free apps use it legitimately), aggressive Adware crosses the line into [[malware|malware]] when it installs without consent, tracks your browsing history to sell to advertisers, or refuses to be uninstalled.

## FAQs

*1. Is it a [[virus]]?*
Technically, no. A [[virus|virus]] replicates (copies itself). Adware typically does not replicate; it just sits there and annoys you to generate revenue.

*2. How do I get it?*
Usually by clicking "Next, Next, Next" too fast when installing free software. It is often "bundled" with legitimate programs.
