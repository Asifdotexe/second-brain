# Purple Team

Coach and sparring partner.

**Purple Teaming** is a collaboration between [[red-team|Red]] (Attackers) and [[blue-team|Blue]] (Defenders).

Instead of a secret attack (Red Team) where the [[blue-team|Blue Team]] doesn't know what's happening, they sit in the same room.
*   **Red:** "I am going to run Attack X now."
*   **Blue:** "Okay, let me see if my alarm triggers... Nope. Try again."
*   **Red:** "Running Attack X again."
*   **Blue:** "Got it! I see you now."

## Goal

To rapidly improve detection capabilities through transparent feedback loops.
