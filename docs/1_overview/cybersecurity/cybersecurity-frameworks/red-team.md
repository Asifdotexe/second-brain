# Red Team

Playing the enemy.

The **Red Team** is a group of security professionals who act as adversaries to an organization's security squad.

Unlike a [[pen-testing|Pen-Test]] (which finds *technical* bugs), a Red Team Operation tests the **People and Processes**. They simulate a full-scale real-world attack: sending [[phishing]] emails, trying to break into the physical building, and moving quietly through the network to steal data without being caught.

## Goal

To train the [[blue-team|Blue-Team]] (Defenders) by giving them a realistic sparring partner. "Train hard, fight easy."

## FAQs

*1. Are they bad guys?*
No. They are employees or contractors hired to attack.
