# Cybersecurity Frameworks & Teams

The structures, systems, and teams that govern modern digital defense.

Cybersecurity is not just about technology; it's about the people and processes that manage risk. This section covers the teams (Red, Blue, Purple), the standards (CVE, CVSS), and the organizations (CISA) that form the backbone of security operations.

## The Catalog of Frameworks & Teams

### 1. [[blue-team|Blue Team]]
The "castle guards" the internal security staff responsible for defending the organization's network, monitoring logs, and patching systems.

### 2. [[red-team|Red Team]]
The "adversaries" security professionals who act as attackers to test an organization's people, processes, and offensive resilience.

### 3. [[purple-team|Purple Team]]
The "coaches" a collaborative unit where Red and Blue teams work together and share transparent feedback to improve detection speed.

### 4. [[soc|SOC (Security Operations Center)]]
Mission Control for cyber defense: a 24/7/365 command center where analysts monitor logs, analyze alerts, and hunt for threats.

### 5. [[incident-response|Incident Response]]
The structured lifecycle (Preparation, Detection, Containment, Eradication, Recovery) used to mitigate the impact of a breach.

### 6. [[cisa|CISA]]
The "nation's risk advisor": a US federal agency dedicated to protecting critical infrastructure and coordinating national cyber risk response.

### 7. [[cve|CVE (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures)]]
The standardized "naming" system that gives every known security flaw a unique ID (e.g., `CVE-2025-12345`) for clear identification.

### 8. [[cvss|CVSS (Common Vulnerability Scoring System)]]
A "credit score" for security bugs, providing a number from 0.0 to 10.0 to help teams prioritize which flaws to fix first.

### 9. [[bug-bounty|Bug Bounty Programs]]
Crowdsourced security where organizations pay "white hat" hackers to find and responsibly disclose vulnerabilities in their systems.

### 10. [[ethical-hackers|Ethical Hackers (White Hat)]]
Security experts who use the same tools as criminals but with legal permission to find and help fix vulnerabilities.

### 11. [[pen-testing|Penetration Testing]]
A "fire drill" for systems: a planned, authorized attempt to breach security measures to evaluate the real-world strength of defenses.
