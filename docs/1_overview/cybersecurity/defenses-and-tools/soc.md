# SOC (Security Operations Center)

Mission Control for cyber defense.

A **SOC** (pronounced "Sock") is the physical room (or team) responsible for monitoring an organization's security 24/7/365.

Imagine a room full of screens like NASA, but instead of watching rockets, they are watching network traffic. Their job is to analyze alerts, hunt for hackers, and respond to incidents before damage occurs.

## The Three Components

1.  **People:** Analysts (Tier 1 triage alerts, Tier 2 investigate deep, Tier 3 hunt threats).
2.  **Processes:** Runbooks (Instructions on what to do when an alarm rings).
3.  **Technology:** Tools like **SIEM** (Security Information and Event Management) that collect logs from every computer and put them nicely on dashboard screens.

## FAQs

*1. Is it a boring job?*
It can be. Tier 1 analysts suffer from **"Alert Fatigue"**—sifting through 10,000 false alarms a day to find the 1 real attack. It is the entry-level rite of passage in Cyber Security.

*2. SOC vs NOC?*
*   **SOC (Security):** Fixes hacks. "Are the bad guys in?"
*   **NOC (Network):** Fixes outages. "Is the WiFi working?"
