# AES-256

The unbreakable glass box.

**AES-256** (Advanced Encryption Standard, 256-bit) is the gold standard for scrambling data so that no one can read it without the key.

Imagine you put a document in a glass box. AES-256 shuffles the atoms of the document 14 times in a row using a password. To reverse it, you need the exact password. If you try to guess it, you would need more energy than all the stars in the universe emitting for billions of years.

## By The Numbers

*   **AES:** The algorithm (the math).
*   **256:** The Key Size. It means the password is 256 ones and zeros long.
    *   **AES-128:** Unbreakable.
    *   **AES-256:** *Paranoid* unbreakable (used for "Top Secret" government files).

## FAQs

*1. Can hackers break it?*
No. They don't break the *box* (AES); they steal the *key* (Password). If hackers get your password, AES can't help you.
*   **Brute Force:** Trying every password? Impossible.
*   **Rubber Hose Cryptanalysis:** Beating the password out of you? Highly effective.

*2. Is it slow?*
It used to be. But modern CPUs have a special "AES-NI" instruction set, meaning your computer can encrypt terabytes of data instantly without slowing down.
