# Shor's Algorithm

The doomsday clock for internet privacy.

**Shor's Algorithm** is a quantum math formula that can break the encryption protecting the entire internet.

Currently, our security (RSA Encryption) relies on the fact that computers are really bad at factoring massive numbers. It would take a supercomputer millions of years to guess the factors.
**Peter Shor** proved that a **[[quantum-computing|Quantum Computer]]** running his algorithm could do it in *hours*.

## The Hook

Imagine a lock that requires you to guess a number between 1 and Infinity.
*   **Classic Computer:** Guesses 1, then 2, then 3... (Takes forever).
*   **Shor's Algorithm:** Guesses *all numbers at once* and finds the pattern that leads to the answer.

## FAQs

*1. Why hasn't the internet crashed yet?*
Because we don't have a Quantum Computer big enough to run it. Yet.
We are currently in the "NISQ" era (Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum). We need thousands of perfect Qubits to break RSA. We currently have hundreds of noisy ones.

*2. What are we doing about it?*
The world is racing to switch to **Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC)**. These are new math problems (like Lattice-based cryptography) that even quantum computers can't solve easily. NIST is currently standardizing them.
