# Bug Bounty

Crowdsourced security testing.

A **Bug Bounty Program** is a deal where a company (like Google or Facebook) says: *"If you can hack us and tell us how you did it, we will pay you cash."*

It turns hackers into allies. Instead of selling a security flaw on the black market (for evil), the hacker sells it to the company (for good).

## Principles

*   **Responsible Disclosure:** The hacker agrees NOT to tell the public about the bug until the company fixes it.
*   **Scope:** The company defines what is "In Bounds" (e.g., website.com) and "Out of Bounds" (e.g., employees' personal laptops).

## FAQs

*1. How much do they pay?*
It depends on the severity ([[cvss|CVSS Score]]).
*   **Low (Typo):** Swag (T-shirt) or $100.
*   **Critical (Remote Code Execution):** $10,000 - $1,000,000+.
*   *Apple pays up to $1 Million for hacking an iPhone.*

*2. Can anyone do it?*
Yes. Platforms like **HackerOne** and **Bugcrowd** allow anyone to sign up and start hunting on public programs legally.
