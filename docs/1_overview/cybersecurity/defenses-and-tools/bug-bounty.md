# Bug Bounty

Getting paid to break things.

A **Bug Bounty** program is a deal offered by many websites and software developers (like Google, Facebook, or the Pentagon) by which individuals can receive recognition and compensation for reporting bugs, especially those pertaining to exploits and vulnerabilities.

## How it works
1.  **Scope:** The company says "Hack our website, but don't touch the payment server."
2.  **Hunt:** You find a way to steal user data.
3.  **Report:** You write a detailed report on how you did it.
4.  **Bounty:** They fix it and pay you (from $500 to $100,000+).

## FAQs

*1. Is it legal?*
Yes, as long as you follow the rules (Scope). If you go out of scope, you are just a criminal.
