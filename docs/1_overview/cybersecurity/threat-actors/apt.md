# Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs)

The ghosts in the machine.

An **Advanced Persistent Threat (APT)** is a sophisticated, long-term cyberattack where an intruder gains access to a network and remains undetected for an extended period.

## Key Characteristics
*   **Advanced**: They have significant expertise and resources. They often use custom malware and "zero-day" exploits.
*   **Persistent**: Their goal is not a quick "smash and grab." They want to stay inside the network as long as possible to slowly leak data.
*   **Threat**: They are highly motivated and targeted. They don't attack random people; they research their targets (large corporations or government agencies) in advance.

## Intentions and Motivation
*   **Espionage**: Stealing political or military information.
*   **Intellectual Property**: Gaining access to trade secrets, patents, or research.
*   **Critical Infrastructure**: Damaging or gaining control over power grids, water systems, or financial institutions.

## How They Work
APTs often start with **[[social-engineering|Social Engineering]]** or a targeted phishing attack to gain an initial foothold. Once inside, they move laterally through the network, escalating their privileges until they reach their ultimate goal.

### Examples in History
*   **[[stuxnet|Stuxnet]]**: Designed to disrupt Iran's nuclear program.
*   **[[notpetya|NotPetya]]**: While disguised as ransomware, it was likely a state-sponsored attack aimed at destruction.
