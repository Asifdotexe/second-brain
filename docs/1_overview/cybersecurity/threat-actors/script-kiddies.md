# Script Kiddies

The copy-paste armies of the internet.

**Script Kiddies** (often shortened to "skiddies") are low-skilled individuals who use pre-written hacking scripts and automated tools to attack computer systems. Unlike professional hackers or nation-state actors, script kiddies usually don't understand *how* the code they are running actually works; they just know how to press "Enter."

## The "Kiddie" Mentality

The term is disparaging, used by the security community to describe a specific type of threat actor:

*   **Reliance on Others:** They download tools made by others (like [[metasploit|Metasploit]], [[loic|LOIC]], or various [[ransomware|ransomware]] kits) and let the software do the heavy lifting.
*   **Motivation:** They are rarely motivated by complex ideology or precise theft. Most script kiddies are out for "bragging rights," digital vandalism, or "the lulz."
*   **Lack of Trace Removal:** Because they don't understand the underlying protocols, they are often noisy and leave obvious trails for security investigators to find.

## Why They Are Still Dangerous

It is a mistake to ignore them just because they are amateurs. They are dangerous for two main reasons:

1.  **Volume:** There are millions of them. Even if a single person isn't a genius, a million people running automated scanners against your server 24/7 will eventually find a hole.
2.  **Military-Grade Tools:** Advanced hacker groups sometimes release their tools (like [[eternalblue|EternalBlue]]). This puts military-grade weapons in the hands of untrained people who might use them recklessly without understanding the consequences.

## FAQs

*1. Are all young hackers script kiddies?*
No. Age has nothing to do with it. A "Script Kiddie" is defined by their **lack of skill and original contribution**. A 14-year-old who writes their own original exploits is a hacker; a 40-year-old who just downloads "Wifi Hacker Pro" is a script kiddie.

*2. How do I defend against them?*
Most script kiddies can be stopped by "Basic Hygiene." They look for the easiest targets. If you keep your software updated (patched), use strong passwords, and have a basic [[firewalls|firewall]], they will usually move on to an easier victim.
