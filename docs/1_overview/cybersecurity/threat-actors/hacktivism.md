# Hacktivism

The Digital Sit-In.

**Hacktivism** is the non-violent use of illegal or legally ambiguous digital tools to pursue political ends.

Think of the internet like a giant, busy city.
*   **Cybercriminals** are like pickpockets or bank robbers; they want your money.
*   **Hacktivists** are like protesters blocking the main highway; they don't want to steal the cars; they want to stop traffic so everyone looks at their sign. They use code as digital graffiti or digital barricades to force a conversation about topics like free speech, human rights, or information freedom.

## Key Tactics

*   **[[ddos|DDoS]] (Distributed Denial of Service):** The Digital Sit-In. Thousands of computers flood a website with traffic until it crashes, effectively "blocking the entrance" to a government agency or corporation.
*   **[[doxing|Doxing]]:** The Digital Outing. Finding and publishing private information (documents, emails, names) of public figures to expose corruption or hypocrisy.
*   **Defacement:** The Digital Graffiti. Taking over a website to replace its homepage with a political message or manifesto.

## FAQs

*1. Is Hacktivism legal?*
Generally, no. Techniques like [[ddos|DDoS]] attacks and unauthorized system access (hacking) are illegal in most countries, regardless of the moral intent.

*2. Are they the "good guys"?*
It depends on who you ask. To their supporters, they are modern-day freedom fighters and whistleblowers holding the powerful accountable. To governments and targeted corporations, they are cyber-terrorists causing chaos and financial damage.
