# Types of Hackers

Not all hats are black.

A **Hacker** is simply a person who uses computers to gain access to systems, networks, or data. In the professional world, we categorize them based on their legality, ethics, and motivation.

## The Three Main Categories

### 1. Authorized Hackers (Ethical Hackers)
Commonly known as **"White Hat"** hackers.
*   **Motivation**: To safeguard people and organizations from malicious actors.
*   **Methods**: They follow a strict code of ethics and always have legal permission (and a contract) before they begin their work.
*   **Tools**: **[[pen-testing|Penetration Testing]]**, vulnerability assessments.

### 2. Semi-Authorized Hackers (Researchers)
Commonly known as **"Grey Hat"** hackers.
*   **Motivation**: Typically curiosity or the desire to improve security.
*   **Methods**: They might scan systems for vulnerabilities *without* permission, but they don't take advantage of them for harm. They often report the bugs to the owner (sometimes for a **[[bug-bounty|Bug Bounty]]**).
*   **Legality**: Their actions are often in a legal "grey area."

### 3. Unauthorized Hackers (Unethical Hackers)
Commonly known as **"Black Hat"** hackers or **Malicious Threat Actors**.
*   **Motivation**: Financial gain, fame, or political agendas.
*   **Methods**: They do not follow the law or respect boundaries. They steal data, plant malware, and disrupt systems.

## Other Terms
*   **[[hactivists|hactivists]]**: Groups (like Anonymous) who use hacking for political agendas, protests, or social change rather than financial gain.
*   **[[script-kiddies|script kiddies]]**: Inexperienced hackers who use pre-made tools and scripts created by others because they don't have the skills to write their own.
