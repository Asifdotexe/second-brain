# Insider Threats

The enemy within.

An **Insider Threat** is a security risk that originates from within the organization. This could be a current or former employee, contractor, or business partner who has authorized access to the network and exploits it for harm.

## Types of Insiders
*   **The Malicious Insider**: A person who intentionally uses their access to harm the organization (e.g., for revenge or financial gain).
*   **The Negligent Insider**: A person who makes a mistake, like clicking a [[phishing|phishing]] link or leaving a server exposed, that allows an external attacker in.
*   **The Compromised Insider**: A person whose credentials have been stolen by an external threat actor without their knowledge.

## Intentions and Motivation
1.  **Sabotage**: Disrupting operations or destroying data.
2.  **Corruption**: Modifying data for personal gain.
3.  **Espionage**: Stealing information to sell to a competitor or foreign government.
4.  **Unauthorized Access or Leaks**: Sharing sensitive data with the public or unauthorized parties.

## Prevention
Protecting against insider threats requires a combination of technical controls and culture:
*   **[[least-privilege|Principle of Least Privilege]]**: Only giving people the access they absolutely need for their job.
*   **Monitoring**: Using **[[siem|[[siem|SIEM]] tools]]** to flag unusual behavior (e.g., someone downloading 10,000 files at 2:00 AM).
*   **Offboarding**: Ensuring all access is immediately revoked when an employee leaves the company.
