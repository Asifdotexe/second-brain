# Ethical Hacker

The good guys breaking in to show you the holes.

An **Ethical Hacker** (or White Hat) is a security expert authorized to try and hack into a system. They use the *same* tools and techniques as malicious hackers (Black Hats), but with one key difference: **Permission**.

Their goal is to find vulnerabilities and report them so they can be fixed *before* the bad guys find them.

## The Hat Colors

*   **White Hat:** Good guys (Authorized).
*   **Black Hat:** Bad guys (Criminals).
*   **Gray Hat:** Chaos neutral. They hack without permission but usually disclose the bug instead of exploiting it (often illegal but well-intentioned).

## FAQs

*1. Is it a real job?*
Yes. Companies pay huge salaries for [[pen-testing|Penetration-Testers]] and [[bug-bounty|Bug-Bounty]] Hunters.
