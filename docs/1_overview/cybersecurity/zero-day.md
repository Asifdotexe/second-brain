# Zero-Day (Vulnerability & Exploit)

### Formal Definition
A "Zero-Day" refers to a security flaw in software that is unknown to the vendor or developer. The term implies that the developers have had **zero days** to fix or patch the issue because they were unaware of its existence before it was discovered or exploited by hackers.

### The Analogy
**The Invisible Backdoor**
Imagine a construction company builds a thousand identical houses with high-security steel doors. However, they accidentally leave a small, invisible gap under the back door that no one notices—not even the builders.
* **Zero-Day Vulnerability:** The invisible gap.
* **Zero-Day Exploit:** A burglar discovering they can slide a wire under that gap to unlock the door.
* **The Risk:** Since the builders don't know the gap exists, they haven't invented a door sweep to block it. Until they do, every house is defenseless against burglars who know the trick.
