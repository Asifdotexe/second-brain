# CISSP Security Domains

The high-level architecture of professional cybersecurity.

The (ISC)² **CISSP** (Certified Information Systems Security Professional) certification is built on eight "domains" that cover every aspect of an organization's security posture.

## The Eight Domains

### 1. Security and [[risk-management|Risk Management]]
Focused on defining security goals, identifying risks, and ensuring compliance with laws and ethics.
*   **Risk Mitigation**: Developing procedures to reduce the impact of a breach.
*   **Business Continuity**: Establishing disaster recovery plans so an organization survives a catastrophe.

### 2. Asset Security
Managing the lifecycle of digital and physical assets, including storage, retention, and secure destruction. It emphasizes protecting **[[privacy-protection|PII and SPII]]**.

### 3. Security Architecture and Engineering
Optimizing security by designing effective tools and systems. It follows principles like **Shared Responsibility**, **[[defense-in-depth|Defense in Depth]]**, and **[[zero-trust|Zero Trust]]**.

### 4. Communication and Network Security
Securing the physical and wireless networks, whether they are on-site, remote, or in the cloud.

### 5. Identity and Access Management (IAM)
Controlling who has access to what. It relies on the four pillars: **Identification**, **Authentication**, **Authorization**, and **Accountability**.

### 6. Security Assessment and Testing
Identifying vulnerabilities before attackers do. This involves **[[pen-testing|Penetration Testing]]** and regular security audits.

### 7. Security Operations
The "front lines" of defense. It focuses on incident investigation, log management (using **[[siem|[[siem|SIEM]] tools]]**), and following **[[playbooks|Playbooks]]** to mitigate active attacks.

### 8. Software Development Security
Embedding security into every phase of the software development lifecycle (SDLC), from design to release.

## Key Concepts
*   **Security Posture**: An organization's overall ability to manage its defense and react to changes in the threat landscape.
*   **Information Security (InfoSec)**: The broader set of processes designed to secure data across all these domains.
