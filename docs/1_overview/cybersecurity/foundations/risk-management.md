# Risk Management Strategies

How organizations decide which battles to fight.

**Risk Management** is the process of identifying, assessing, and controlling threats to an organization's capital and earnings. In cybersecurity, we focus on protecting assets (digital and physical) from threats and vulnerabilities.

## The Four Core Strategies
When faced with a risk, organizations typically choose one of these four paths:

1.  **Acceptance**: Acknowledging the risk exists but choosing not to take any action because the cost of fixing it is higher than the possible damage.
2.  **Avoidance**: Completely eliminating the risk by stopping the activity that causes it (e.g., shutting down a vulnerable server).
3.  **Transference**: Shifting the risk to a third party (e.g., buying **Cyber Insurance**).
4.  **Mitigation**: Taking active steps to reduce the likelihood or impact of the risk (e.g., installing a firewall).

## Assets, Threats, and Vulnerabilities
To manage risk, you must understand the relationship between these three:

*   **Assets**: Anything of value (SSNs, bank accounts, servers).
*   **Threats**: Potential events that can negatively impact an asset (e.g., an [[apt|APT]] or an [[insider-threats|Insider Threat]]).
*   **Vulnerabilities**: Weaknesses that can be exploited (e.g., a missing security patch).

**Risk = Likelihood of a Threat * Impact on an Asset.**

## Common Vulnerabilities
High-profile examples of weaknesses that require active management:
*   **Log4Shell**: A critical flaw in a common logging tool.
*   **ZeroLogon**: A flaw that allowed attackers to take over a Windows domain controller.

## Frameworks
Cybersecurity professionals use standardized frameworks to guide their risk management:
*   **NIST RMF**: The Risk Management Framework created by the U.S. government.
*   **HITRUST**: A framework specifically designed for the healthcare industry.
