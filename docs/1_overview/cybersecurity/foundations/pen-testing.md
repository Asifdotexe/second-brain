# Penetration Testing (Pen Test)

The fire drill.

**Penetration Testing** is a simulated cyberattack against your computer system to check for exploitable vulnerabilities. It is an authorized, planned attempt to breach security measures.

It answers the question: "Are our defenses actually working?"

## Phases of a Pen Test

1.  **Reconnaissance:** Gathering info on the target.
2.  **Scanning:** Looking for open ports/weaknesses.
3.  **Exploitation:** Trying to break in.
4.  **Reporting:** Writing a PDF telling the company how you broke in and how to fix it.

## FAQs

*1. Pen Test vs. Vulnerability Scan?*
*   **Vuln Scan:** Automated. A robot checks for known issues (Unlocked doors). Cheap and fast.
*   **Pen Test:** Manual. A human thinks creatively to chain small issues into a big breach (Climbing through the unlocked window). Expensive and thorough.
