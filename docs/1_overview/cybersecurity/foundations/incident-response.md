# Incident Response (IR)

The structured process an organization follows to identify, manage, and mitigate the impact of a cybersecurity breach or cyberattack.

The goal of incident response is to handle the situation in a way that limits damage and reduces recovery time and costs.

## The IR Lifecycle (NIST Framework)

1.  **Preparation**: Establishing a team (CSIRT), tools, and processes before an incident occurs.
2.  **Detection & Analysis**: Identifying suspicious activity and determining if it’s a real threat.
3.  **Containment, Eradication, & Recovery**:
    *   **Containment**: Stopping the threat from spreading (e.g., isolating a server).
    *   **Eradication**: Removing the root cause of the incident (e.g., deleting [[malware]]).
    *   **Recovery**: Restoring systems to normal operation.
4.  **Post-Incident Activity**: "Lessons Learned" to improve future response.

## Key Concepts
- **CSIRT**: Computer Security Incident Response Team.
- **Playbook**: A step-by-step guide for responding to specific types of attacks (e.g., [[ransomware]] playbook).
- **[[soc|SOC]]**: The Security Operations Center often houses the IR function.
