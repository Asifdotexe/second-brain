# Firewall

The club bouncer.

A **Firewall** is a network security device (software or hardware) that monitors incoming and outgoing network traffic. It decides whether to allow or block specific traffic based on a defined set of security rules.

*   "Traffic from Google.com? Come in."
*   "Traffic from sketchy-hacker-site.ru? Blocked."

## Types

*   **Packet Filtering:** Checks the address label on the envelope (IP address/Port).
*   **Next-Gen Firewall (NGFW):** Opens the envelope and reads the letter (Deep Packet Inspection) to stop malware hiding inside legitimate traffic.

## FAQs

*1. Do I need one?*
Yes. Your computer (Windows/Mac) has a software firewall built-in. Your WiFi Router acts as a hardware firewall. They are your first line of defense against the internet.
