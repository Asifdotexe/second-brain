# BeyondTrust

A cybersecurity company specializing in **Privileged Access Management (PAM)** and secure remote access solutions.

BeyondTrust tools are designed to prevent hackers from moving sideways through a network by tightly controlling who has "admin" rights and what they can do with them.

## Core Solutions

- **Privileged Access Management (PAM)**: Managing and auditing administrative credentials to prevent credential theft.
- **Remote Support**: Allowing IT teams to securely access and fix devices across the internet (this tool is sometimes targeted for [[remote-code-execution|RCE]] attacks).
- **Privilege Management for Desktops**: Removing local admin rights from users while still allowing them to run approved applications.

## Why it Matters
Many modern attacks involve stealing a low-level worker's password and then "escalating privileges" to become a domain admin. BeyondTrust helps stop this chain of events.
