# VPN

A private tunnel through the public internet.

The internet is like a public highway. Everyone (hackers, your ISP, the government) can see the digital "cars" (data) you are driving and where you are going.

A **VPN** (Virtual Private Network) builds a secure, opaque tunnel around your car. No one can see inside the tunnel to see who you are, what data you are carrying, or exactly where you are headed.

## Why use it?

### 1. Privacy (The Mask)
Without a VPN, websites see your IP address (your digital home address). With a VPN, they only see the VPN server's address. You could be in London, but the website thinks you are in New York.

### 2. Security (The Armour)
Public WiFi (like at Starbucks) is dangerous. Hackers can easily intercept your traffic. A VPN encrypts your data, turning it into gibberish. Even if a hacker steals it, they can't read it.

### 3. Access (The Teleporter)
Some content is blocked in certain countries (Geoblocking). A VPN lets you "tunnel out" to a different country to access that content.

## FAQs

*1. Does a VPN make me anonymous?*
**No.** It gives you *privacy*, not *anonymity*.
*   Your ISP can't see what you do.
*   But the **VPN Provider** CAN see what you do. You are shifting your trust from Comcast/AT&T to NordVPN/ExpressVPN. Always choose a trusted paid provider that promises "No Logs."

*2. Does it slow down my internet?*
Yes, slightly. Your data has to travel to the VPN server first, get encrypted, and then go to the destination. It's a detour.
