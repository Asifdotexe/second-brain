# Malware

Software designed to harm.

**Malware** (short for "Malicious Software") is an umbrella term for any program or code that is created to do bad things to a computer, network, or server. It is the general term; "virus" is just one specific type.

Think of "Malware" as "Sickness," and things like Flu, Cold, and Chickenpox are the specific types.

## Common Types of Malware

*   **Worms:** Self-replicating programs that spread across networks without human help.
*   **Virus:** Attaches itself to legitimate files and spreads when you open them.
*   **Logic Bombs:** Code hidden in a system that "detonates" (executes) only when specific conditions are met (like a specific date).
*   **Wipers:** Designed purely to delete data and destroy systems forever.
*   **Keyloggers:** Spies that record every keystroke you type (including passwords).
*   **Trojan:** Disguises itself as helpful software (like a game or tool) to trick you into installing it.
