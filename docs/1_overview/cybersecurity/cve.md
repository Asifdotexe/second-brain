# CVE: Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures

### What is it?
CVE stands for **Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures**; it is a standardized list that gives every known computer security flaw a unique "name" (ID number) so everyone can talk about it without confusion.

**A CVE ID always looks like this: `CVE-2025-12345`**
CVE -> Standard List Marker
2023 -> Year Assigned
23397 -> Unique Bug ID
