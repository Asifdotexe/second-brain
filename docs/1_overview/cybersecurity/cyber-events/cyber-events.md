# Cyber Events & Incidents

Historical milestones in the evolution of digital warfare.

Cybersecurity history is defined by the attacks that forced the world to change. From military-grade exploits leaked to the public to destructive "wipers" that paralyzed global shipping, these events illustrate the real-world impact of malicious code.

## The Catalog of Cyber Events

### 1. [[wanna-cry|WannaCry (2017)]]
A global ransomware epidemic that infected 200,000+ computers in 150 countries. It was famously halted by an accidental "kill switch" discovered by a security researcher.

### 2. [[notpetya|NotPetya (2017)]]
Disguised as ransomware, this "wiper" attack targeted Ukraine but spread globally, causing $10 billion in damage by permanently destroying data rather than encrypting it.

### 3. [[shamoon|Shamoon (2012)]]
A destructive attack against Saudi Aramco that "bricked" 35,000 computers and replaced their data with a burning American flag, disrupting the global energy sector.

### 4. [[eternalblue|EternalBlue]]
A powerful exploit developed by the NSA and leaked by the "Shadow Brokers." It became the engine for many major attacks by allowing malware to spread automatically across Windows networks.

### 5. [[glassworm|GlassWorm (2025)]]
A modern "invisible" worm that targets software developers by hiding malicious code in VS Code extensions using invisible characters and blockchain-based command control.

### 6. [[hacktivism|Hacktivism]]
The use of digital tools (DDoS, Doxing, Defacement) for political ends, where "code" acts as a form of protest, whistleblowing, or digital civil disobedience.

### 7. [[cyber-warfare|Cyber Warfare]]
The use of digital attacks by nation-states to disrupt, damage, or spy on another nation's physical or digital infrastructure.
