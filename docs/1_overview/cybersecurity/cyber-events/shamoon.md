# Shamoon

The burning of the oil fields, digital edition.

**Shamoon** (2012) is an aggressive cyber-weapon used by Iranian state hackers to attack the **Saudi Aramco** oil company (the richest company in the world).

It didn't just spy. It was a \"suicide bomber\" for computers. It spread through the network, wiped the hard drives, and then replaced all the data with a picture of a **burning American flag**.

## The Impact

In a matter of hours, it turned **35,000 computers** into useless bricks.
*   Saudi Aramco had to disconnect from the internet entirely.
*   The price of hard drives globally spiked because Aramco bought every spare drive in the world to replace their fleet.
*   Company trucks couldn't even fill up gas because the digital pumps were offline. They had to use paper and pencil for weeks.

## FAQs

*1. How did it get in?*
Someone clicked a phishing link (likely malicious email attachment) or used an infected USB stick. The oldest trick in the book.

*2. Why is it significant?*
It was the first major instance of cyber warfare targeting the **Energy Sector** destructively. It showed the world that a piece of code could threaten the global oil supply.
