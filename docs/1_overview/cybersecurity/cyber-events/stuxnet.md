# Stuxnet

The digital spark that caused a physical fire.

**Stuxnet** is a extremely sophisticated malicious computer worm, first uncovered in 2010, that was specifically designed to sabotage Iran's nuclear program. It is widely considered the world's first "cyber-physical weapon"; a piece of code designed not just to steal data, but to reach out and physically destroy machinery.

Unlike most malware that steals credit cards or locks files for ransom, Stuxnet was a precision-guided missile made of 1s and 0s.

## How it Works

Stuxnet was designed with a very specific "kill chain" to target the Natanz uranium enrichment facility:

1.  **Jumping the Air-Gap:** The facility was not connected to the internet (an "air-gap"). Stuxnet spread via infected USB sticks. When a worker plugged a stick into a target computer inside the facility, the worm jumped the gap.
2.  **The Hunt:** Once inside, it didn't do anything to normal PCs. It looked for a specific type of **PLC (Programmable Logic Controller)** made by Siemens that controlled the speed of uranium-enrichment centrifuges.
3.  **The Sabotage:** It took control of the centrifuges and forced them to spin at wildly fluctuating speeds; first dangerously fast, then dangerously slow. This physical stress caused the centrifuges to vibrate until they literally shattered.
4.  **The Camouflage:** While destroying the machines, Stuxnet "replayed" normal sensor data to the control room monitors. The operators saw everything as "perfectly normal" while their machines were actually tearing themselves apart.

## FAQs

*1. Who made it?*
While no one has officially claimed credit, the complexity of the code (utilizing four "Zero-Day" exploits) suggests a nation-state. Analysts generally point to a joint operation between the **US and Israel** (Operation Olympic Games).

*2. Why is it a "turning point" in history?*
Before Stuxnet, cyber-attacks were mostly about virtual damage (deleted files, downtime). Stuxnet proved that a hacker in one country could physically destroy a factory in another without ever firing a bullet or crossing a border.
