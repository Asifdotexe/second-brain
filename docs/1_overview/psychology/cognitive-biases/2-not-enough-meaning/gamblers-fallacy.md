# Gambler's Fallacy

The Coin Has No Memory.

**The Gambler's Fallacy** is the mistaken belief that if something generally happens more frequently than normal during a given period, it will happen *less* frequently in the future (or vice versa).

You flip a coin. Heads. Heads. Heads. Heads. Heads.
What's next? You scream "Tails! It *has* to be Tails! It's due!"
**Wrong.** The probability is still 50/50. The coin doesn't know it just landed on Heads 5 times. It has no memory. You are inventing a "balancing force" in the universe that doesn't exist.

## Why it Happens

Humans are obsessed with patterns. We expect small samples (10 coin flips) to look like the global average (50/50 distribution). When they don't, we assume the universe will "correct" itself immediately.

## FAQs

*1. Does this apply to the Stock Market?*
Big time. Investors often sell a stock because "it's gone up for 10 days straight, it *must* come down." While markets do correct, they don't do it just because they "owe" you a drop.

*2. Is "Regression to the Mean" the same thing?*
No. Regression to the mean is a statistical fact: over time, extreme scores average out. Gambler's Fallacy is the *belief* that the next specific turn will be the correction.
