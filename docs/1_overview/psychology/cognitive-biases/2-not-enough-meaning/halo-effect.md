# Halo Effect

The "Angel Script."

**The Halo Effect** is a cognitive bias where the impression of one positive trait influences your opinion of a person's other (unrelated) traits.

If you meet someone who is tall, good-looking, and well-dressed, your brain instantly assumes they are also smart, funny, and successful. You assume because they have *one* "good" quality (beauty), they must have *all* good qualities (a "halo"). Just like in a movie script: the Hero is beautiful *and* kind *and* brave.

## Why it Happens

Your brain acts like a lazy autocomplete function.
*   **Input:** "He is attractive."
*   **Autocomplete:** "...therefore he is a good leader and a nice person."
It creates a consistent narrative because "Beautiful but Evil" is harder for the brain to process quickly than "Beautiful and Good."

## FAQs

*1. Is the reverse true?*
Yes. That is the **Horn Effect**. If someone is messy or unattractive, you subconsciously assume they are also lazy or incompetent, even if they are a genius.

*2. Where is this most dangerous?*
**Hiring and Politics.** We often vote for or hire the person who "looks the part" (tall, deep voice) rather than the person with the best skills. Apple's Steve Jobs famously used his "Reality Distortion Field" (charisma) to make people believe impossible deadlines were possible.
