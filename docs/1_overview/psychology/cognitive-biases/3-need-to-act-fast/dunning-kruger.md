Mount Stupid.

**The Dunning-Kruger Effect** is a cognitive bias where people with low ability at a task overestimate their ability.

Basically: **Incompetent people are too incompetent to realize they are incompetent.**
To know you are bad at grammar, you need to know the rules of grammar. If you don't know the rules, you assume your emails are perfect.

## The Curve (The Analogy)

1.  **Mount Stupid:** You learn a little bit and think, "I'm a genius! This is easy!" (High Confidence, Low Competence).
2.  **Valley of Despair:** You learn more and realize, "Oh god, this is actually incredibly hard." (Low Confidence, Med Competence).
3.  **Slope of Enlightenment:** You actually get good and your confidence slowly returns. (High Confidence, High Competence).

## FAQs

*1. Is it just for "Stupid" people?*
No! It hits smart people too. A brilliant programmer might think they can easily run a marketing campaign ("How hard can writing ads be?"). We are all Dunning-Kruger victims in fields we don't know.

*2. How do I fix it?*
Assume you know nothing. Seek feedback early. The only cure for the Dunning-Kruger effect is **Metacognition** (thinking about your own thinking).
