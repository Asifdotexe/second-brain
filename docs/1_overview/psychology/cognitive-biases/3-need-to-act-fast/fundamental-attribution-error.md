**The Fundamental Attribution Error** is the tendency to believe that what people *do* reflects who they keeping *are*, while ignoring the situation they are in.

*   **When someone cuts you off in traffic:** You scream, "What a jerk!" (You blame their **Personality**).
*   **When YOU cut someone off:** You think, "I'm sorry, I'm just late for a flight!" (You blame the **Situation**).
We judge others by their character, but we judge ourselves by our circumstances.

## The Equation

*   **Their Behavior** = **Their Flaw** (Internal Attribution).
*   **My Behavior** = **My Environment** (External Attribution).

## FAQs

*1. Why do we do this?*
Because we can see *them*, but we can't see the *pressure* they are under. When you watch an actor trip, you see a clumsy person. You don't see the slippery floor because your eyes are focused on the person.

*2. How does this help me?*
It is the secret to **Empathy**. Next time a coworker is rude, instead of thinking "They are mean," try thinking "They might be having a terrible day." It stops you from taking things personally and escalating conflicts.
