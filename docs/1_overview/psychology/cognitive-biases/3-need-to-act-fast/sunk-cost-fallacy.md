**The Sunk Cost Fallacy** is the tendency to continue an endeavor just because we have already invested money, effort, or time into it, even if the current costs outweigh the benefits.

*   **The Movie Theater:** You paid $20 for a ticket. The movie is terrible. 30 minutes in, you are bored.
    *   *Rational Choice:* Leave. The $20 is gone regardless. Why lose $20 AND 2 hours of time?
    *   *Sunk Cost Choice:* "I paid for it, so I have to get my money's worth." (So you suffer for 2 more hours).

## The Logic

Your brain hates "Loss." Admitting the money is gone feels like a loss. Continuing feels like you are "saving" the investment.
**Rule:** Past costs (Sunk Costs) should *never* factor into future decisions. Only future costs and benefits matter.

## FAQs

*1. Does this apply to relationships?*
Yes. "We've been together for 5 years, I can't break up now." If the relationship is bad, the 5 years are "sunk." Staying another 5 years just means wasting 10 years total.

*2. Why is it hard to quit?*
Because quitting looks like failure. Our egos are tied to our past decisions. We want to prove to ourselves (and others) that we made the right choice, even if the ship is sinking.
