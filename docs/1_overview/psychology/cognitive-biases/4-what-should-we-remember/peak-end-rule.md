# Peak-End Rule

The Highlight Reel.

**The Peak-End Rule** is the psychological heuristic where we judge an experience strictly by how it felt at its most intense point (the "Peak") and at its end (the "End"), rather than the average of the whole experience.

Imagine a 10-day vacation.
*   **Scenario A:** 9 amazing days, but on Day 10 you lose your luggage.
*   **Scenario B:** 3 good days, 6 okay days, and on Day 10 you get a free upgrade.
You will remember **Scenario B** as the "better" trip, even though Scenario A had more total happiness. Your brain ignores the duration; it only saves the snapshots of the Climax and the Finale.

## Why it Happens

Memory is expensive. Your brain doesn't record a video of your life; it keeps a scrapbook. It only has room for the emotional spikes and the most recent moment.

## FAQs

*1. How is this used against me?*
**Disney World.** You wait in line for 2 hours (pain), spend 5 minutes on the ride (Peak), and buy a souvenir on the way out (End). You forget the 2 hours of sweating and remember it as "Magical."

*2. How can I use this?*
If you have a bad meeting or a bad date, try to crack a joke or give a compliment right at the **end**. The other person will remember the whole interaction much more fondly.
