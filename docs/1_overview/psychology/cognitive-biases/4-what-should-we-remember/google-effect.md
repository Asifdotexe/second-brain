**The Google Effect** (or Digital Amnesia) is the tendency to forget information that can be found readily online by using Internet search engines.

Your brain is an efficient [[hard-drive|hard drive]] manager. If it knows a file is backed up to the Cloud (Google), it deletes the local copy to save space.
*   **Old Days:** You memorized phone numbers because you had to.
*   **Now:** You don't know your best friend's number because your phone "knows" it for you.

## The Trade-Off

We are becoming better at knowing **Where** to find information (Index Memory) and worse at knowing **What** the information is (Content Memory).
*   *Pros:* We can access infinite knowledge.
*   *Cons:* We are helpless without connection.

## FAQs

*1. Is it making us stupid?*
Debatable. Some argue it frees up brain power for "higher-level" thinking (creativity, analysis) instead of rote memorization. Others argue that you can't think deeply about a subject if you don't have the facts stored in your head.

*2. How do I fight it?*
If you want to remember something, **write it down by hand**. The physical act of writing signals to your brain: "This is important, keep a local copy."
