# Survivor Bias

Looking at the armor damage on returning fighter planes and reinforcing those spots, forgetting completely that the planes hit in other spots didn't return at all.

**Survivor Bias** (or Survivorship Bias) is a logical error and cognitive bias where you draw conclusions based entirely on an incomplete set of data because only the "survivors" or successful outcomes are visible to you. By fundamentally ignoring the failures (because they are invisible or were destroyed), your resulting analysis is dangerously skewed.

This happens everywhere, from business (studying only successful CEOs and ignoring the 99% who did the exact same things but failed) to architecture (believing "they don't build houses like they used to" simply because all the poorly built houses from 100 years ago already collapsed and only the strong ones survived to the present day).

## The Anthropic Principle

In philosophy and cosmology, a massive, universe-scale version of Survivor Bias is known as the **Anthropic Principle**. 

When people look at the fundamental laws of physics, they often marvel at how perfectly calibrated they are for human life to exist (see [[fine-tuning-argument|The Fine-Tuning Argument]]). The Anthropic Principle is the counter-argument: *Of course* the universe we observe possesses the exact properties required for the observer to exist. If the universe's physics were hostile to our existence, we simply wouldn't be here to observe it. We are the ultimate survivors looking at our own dataset.

## How to Defeat Survivor Bias

To conquer this bias when making decisions or analyzing data, you must aggressively hunt for the missing data:
1.  **Ask "What am I not seeing?"** - Actively look for the failures.
2.  **Examine the Drop-Outs** - If you are studying successful startups, you must study 10 failed startups in the exact same industry to see if they actually did the same things as the successful ones.

## FAQs

*1. How is this different from [[confirmation-bias|Confirmation Bias]]?*
[[confirmation-bias|Confirmation Bias]] is actively filtering out data that disagrees with what you already believe. Survivor Bias is when the data *actually is missing* from your dataset because the "losers" have been naturally removed from the pool before you got there.

*2. How did they fix the fighter planes?*
During WWII, statistician Abraham Wald realized the military was making a fatal error in analyzing bullet hole patterns on returning bombers. By applying inverse logic, he recommended putting heavy armor *where the returning planes had no damage*, correctly deducing that planes hit in those untouched areas were the ones being shot down and not making it back.
