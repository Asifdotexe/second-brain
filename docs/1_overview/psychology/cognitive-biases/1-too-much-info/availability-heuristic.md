**The Availability Heuristic** is a mental shortcut where we judge the likelihood of an event based on how easily we can recall similar examples.

If you ask someone, "What is more likely to kill you: A shark or a falling coconut?" most people intuitively scream "SHARK!" Why? because you've seen the movie *Jaws*. You recall catchy news headlines about shark attacks. You have *zero* vivid memories of coconut deaths.
Your brain assumes: **"If I can remember it easily, it must happen often."**

## How it Works

Your brain uses "Ease of Recall" as a proxy for "Frequency."
*   **Vivid events** (plane crashes, kidnapping, winning the lottery) stick in memory.
*   **Boring events** (car crashes, heart disease, losing the lottery) fade away.
Result: We are terrified of planes but text while driving.

## FAQs

*1. Is this why the news feels so scary?*
Yes. The news reports *anomalies* (rare, scary things). If you watch the news every day, your availability heuristic is hacked to believe the world is far more dangerous than it statistically is.

*2. How does it affect business?*
Performance reviews. A manager might judge an employee's entire year based on a mistake they made *yesterday*, because that memory is the most "available."
