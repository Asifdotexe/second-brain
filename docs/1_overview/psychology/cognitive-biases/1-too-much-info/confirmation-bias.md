# Confirmation Bias

The "Yes Man" inside your head.

**Confirmation Bias** is the tendency to search for, interpret, favor, and recall information in a way that confirms your pre-existing beliefs or hypotheses.

Imagine you are looking for a new car. You decide you want a red Toyota. Suddenly, you see red Toyotas *everywhere*. Did the factory just make more? No. Your brain is filtering out the blue Hondas and white Fords because they don't match your current "mission." Confirmation Bias works the same way with ideas. If you believe "Left-handed people are creative," you will notice every creative lefty and ignore every uncreative one.

## How it Works

1.  **Filtering:** You subconsciously ignore evidence that contradicts your view (Disconfirmation Bias).
2.  **Interpretation:** You twist ambiguous evidence to support your view. (e.g., "He didn't text back because he's busy," not "He's not interested," because you *want* to believe he likes you).
3.  **Memory:** You remember the times you were right and forget the times you were wrong.

## FAQs

*1. Is it lying?*
No, it's not intentional deception. It's an efficiency mechanism. Your brain wants to save energy. Changing your mind requires re-wiring neural pathways (hard work). Keeping your current opinion requires doing nothing (easy).

*2. How do I beat it?*
Actively look for the **disconfirming evidence**. Ask yourself: "If I were wrong, what would I expect to see?" Then look for *that*.
