**Anchoring Bias** is the cognitive tendency to rely too heavily on the first piece of information offered (the "anchor") when making decisions.

Imagine walking into a luxury store. You see a bag for $5,000. "Insane!" you think. Then you see a smaller bag for $1,200. "Ooh, that's a steal!"
Is $1,200 a good price for a bag? Probably not. But because your brain was "anchored" to the $5,000 price, the $1,200 feels cheap by comparison. The first number you see sets the stage for everything that follows.

## Key Examples

*   **Salary Negotiation:** The first number spoken usually dictates the final range. If you ask for $100k, the negotiation happens around $100k. If you ask for $60k, you'll never get to $100k.
*   **Sales:** "Was $100, Now $50!" The $100 is a fake anchor designed to make the $50 feel like a win.

## FAQs

*1. Does it work even if the number is random?*
Yes. Studies show that if you ask people to write down the last two digits of their social security number, and then bid on a bottle of wine, people with higher SSN numbers bid higher. The brain clings to *any* available number when it's unsure.

*2. How do I avoid it?*
Do your research *before* you enter the room. If you know the car is worth $20k, the dealer's $30k sticker price won't anchor you because you brought your own anchor.
