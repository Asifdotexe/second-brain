# Power Law

Extremistan.

**A Power Law** (Pareto Distribution) is a pattern where a small number of items account for the vast majority of the impact. The average is meaningless because one "[[black-swan|Black Swan]]" can skew the whole dataset.

Think of it like **Book Sales**.
*   **The [[long-tail|Long Tail]]:** Millions of authors sell 10 copies.
*   **The Head:** J.K. Rowling sells 500 million copies.
*   **The Skew:** If you average J.K. Rowling with me, we are both best-selling authors *on average*. But the average is a lie.

## How it Works

1.  **Preferential Attachment:** "The rich get richer." If you have 1 million followers, gaining the next follower is easier than if you have 0.
2.  **Scale Invariance:** The pattern looks the same at any scale (fractal).
3.  **No Tyical Member:** In a Bell Curve, a variance of 10-sigma is impossible. In a Power Law, it's expected.

## Real World Use Cases

*   **Wealth:** The 80/20 Rule (80% of wealth is owned by 20% of people).
*   **City Sizes:** A few mega-cities, thousands of small towns.
*   **Web Traffic:** Google gets billions of hits; this page i.e., second brain gets three.

## Analysis

## Analysis

In a Power Law world, [[risk-management|risk management]] is hard. The past does not predict the future. One single event (an earthquake, a market crash, a viral post) can change everything. See **[[black-swan|Black Swan]]**.
