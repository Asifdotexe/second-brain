# Normal Distribution

Mediocristan.

**The Normal Distribution** (Bell Curve) is the most common pattern in nature. Most things are average, and extreme deviations are rare and symmetric.

Think of it like **Adult Male Height**.
*   **The Average:** Most men are around 5'9".
*   **The Deviations:** A few are 6'5", a few are 5'2".
*   **The Impossible:** No one is 500 feet tall.

## How it Works

1.  **[[central-limit-theorem|Central Limit Theorem]]:** When you add up many independent random variables, they tend to form a Bell Curve.
2.  **Symmetry:** 50% are above average, 50% are below.
3.  **The 68-95-99.7 Rule:**
    *   68% of data falls within 1 **[[standard-deviation|[[standard-deviation|Standard Deviation]] (SD)]]**.
    *   95% falls within 2 SDs.
    *   99.7% falls within 3 SDs.

## Real World Use Cases

*   **IQ Tests:** Designed to be a Bell Curve with 100 as the mean.
*   **Manufacturing:** Checking bolt sizes. If too many are "outliers" (outside 3 SDs), the machine is broken.
*   **height/Weight:** Biology usually follows this.

## Analysis

In a Normal world, prediction is easy. Historical data (last 100 years of flood data) accurately predicts the future. You are safe from "Black Swans" (mostly).
