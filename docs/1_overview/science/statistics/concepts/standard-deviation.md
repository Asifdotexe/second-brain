# Standard Deviation

The Spread.

**Standard Deviation (SD)** is a measure of how spread out numbers are.
*   **Low SD:** Data is bunched up near the average (Reliable).
*   **High SD:** Data is all over the place (Chaotic).

Think of it like **Pizza Delivery**.
*   **Pizza A:** Always arrives in exactly 30 mins. (Average = 30, SD = 0).
*   **Pizza B:** Arrives in 10 mins or 50 mins. (Average = 30, SD = High).
*   **The Lesson:** Even if the *average* is the same, Pizza B is risky. SD measures that risk.

## Why it Matters

In a **[[normal-distribution|Normal Distribution]]**, SD is the ruler we use to measure weirdness.
*   **1 Sigma (SD):** Normal stuff (68% of people).
*   **3 Sigmas:** Rare stuff (Top 1% genius).
*   **6 Sigmas:** Miracle/Disaster (Winning the lottery).
