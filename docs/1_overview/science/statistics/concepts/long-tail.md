# The Long Tail

The Niche.

**The Long Tail** refers to the strategy of selling a large number of unique items with relatively small quantities sold of each, usually in addition to selling fewer popular items in large quantities.

Think of it like **Amazon vs. Bookstore**.
*   **Bookstore:** Limited shelf space. They only stock the "Hits" (top 1,000 books) that guarantee sales.
*   **Amazon:** Unlimited database space. They stock the "Long Tail" (millions of obscure books).
*   **The Math:** Selling 1 copy of 1 million obscure books = Selling 1 million copies of Harry Potter.

## Why it Matters

In a **[[power-law|Power Law]]** distribution, the "Tail" is infinitely long. The internet makes it profitable to mine the tail, whereas physical stores can only afford the "Head."
