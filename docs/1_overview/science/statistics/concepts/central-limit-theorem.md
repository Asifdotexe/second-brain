# Central Limit Theorem

The Magnet.

**The Central Limit Theorem (CLT)** states that if you take enough random samples from *any* population (even a weird one), the *averages* of those samples will inherently form a **[[normal-distribution|Normal Distribution]]** (Bell Curve).

Think of it like **Rolling Dice**.
*   **One Die:** Rolling a 1 is just as likely as a 6. (Flat distribution).
*   **Ten Dice:** The *average* of 10 dice will almost always be around 3.5. Rolling all 1s (Average 1) is nearly impossible.
*   **The Magnet:** The more dice you roll, the harder the average is pulled toward the center.

## Why it Matters

This is why we can use Statistics on almost anything. We don't need to know the shape of the original data; if we survey enough people, their *averages* will behave like a nice, predictable Bell Curve.
