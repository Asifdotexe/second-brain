# Black Swan

The Impossible Event.

**A Black Swan** is an event that is:
1.  **Rare:** Outside regular expectations.
2.  **Impactful:** Carries extreme consequences.
3.  **Retrospectively Predictable:** Creating an explanation *after* the fact ("We should have seen it coming").

Think of it like **The Turkey Problem**.
*   **The Data:** For 1,000 days, the farmer feeds the turkey. The turkey's data says "Farmer = Friend." Confirming evidence increases every day.
*   **The Event:** Day 1,001 is Thanksgiving.
*   **The Lesson:** Past data did not predict the future. The most important event in the turkey's life was a Black Swan that no chart could foresee.

## Why it Matters

In **[[power-law|Power Law]]** environments (finance, pandemics, internet), Black Swans drive history. Standard models (like the Bell Curve) ignore them as "outliers," which is why banks crash.
