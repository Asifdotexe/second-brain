# Pareto Principle

The 80/20 Rule.

**The Pareto Principle** states that for many outcomes, roughly 80% of consequences come from 20% of the causes. It is a specific application of the **[[power-law|Power Law]]**.

Think of it like **Your Carpet**.
*   **The Rule:** 20% of your carpet gets 80% of the foot traffic.
*   **The Business:** 20% of customers provide 80% of revenue.
*   **The Code:** 20% of the bugs cause 80% of the crashes.

## Why it Matters

It is the ultimate tool for **Efficiency**. You don't need to fix *everything*. You just need to find the vital 20% that drives the result and fix that.
