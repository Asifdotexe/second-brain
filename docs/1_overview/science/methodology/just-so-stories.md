# Just-So Stories

A story that fits perfectly because it was made backwards.

A **Just-So Story** is a criticism (coined by Stephen Jay Gould) of scientific explanations that sound plausible but are untestable and purely speculative.
The name comes from Rudyard Kipling's children's book *Just So Stories* (e.g., "How the Leopard Got His Spots").

## The Flaw

It is often used in **Evolutionary Psychology** to explain modern behavior by inventing a prehistoric reason for it.

*   *Observation:* Men like blue.
*   *Just-So Story:* "Ah, well, prehistoric men had to look at the sky to predict rain, so they evolved to like blue."
*   *Problem:* It sounds smart, but **how do you test it?** You can't. It's just a creative writing exercise. You could just as easily argue men like blue because berries are blue.

## FAQs

*1. Is all Evolutionary Psychology bad?*
No. But good science requires **[[novel-prediction|Novel Predictions]]**.
*   **Just-So:** Explaining why we *already* act this way.
*   **Science:** Predicting that if we act this way, we should also find *this specific gene* or *this specific fossil*.

*2. How to spot one?*
Ask: "Is there any evidence for this besides the fact that it sounds logical?" If the answer is No, it's a Just-So Story.
