# Scientific Method

The algorithm for debugging the universe.

**The Scientific Method** is a systematic process for gathering data and testing ideas to minimize bias and error.

Imagine your lamp doesn't turn on. You don't just guess "ghosts did it." You inherently use the scientific method:
1.  **Observation:** "The lamp is off."
2.  **Hypothesis:** "Maybe the bulb is burnt out."
3.  **Experiment:** You screw in a new bulb.
4.  **Result:** It lights up.
5.  **Conclusion:** "The old bulb was dead."
Science is just this process, but rigorous, documented, and peer-reviewed so that we can trust the results even if we didn't do the experiment ourselves.

## The Cycle
The method is circular, not a straight line. Every answer leads to new questions.

1.  **Ask a Question:** What are you trying to solve?
2.  **Do Background Research:** Has someone else already solved this?
3.  **Construct a Hypothesis:** An educated guess you can test (must be [[falsifiability|falsifiable]]).
4.  **Test with an Experiment:** A fair test that isolates variables.
5.  **Analyze Data:** What happened?
6.  **Communicate Results:** Tell others so they can check your work.

## FAQs

*1. Do scientists actually follow these steps 1-2-3-4?*
In the real world, it's messy. Scientists often jump back and forth, refining their hypothesis while designing the experiment, or finding accidental discoveries (like Penicillin) that change the original question entirely. The "steps" are more of a checklist for logic than a strict recipe.

*2. What if my experiment fails?*
Then you did good science! Proving a hypothesis *wrong* is just as valuable as proving it right. It tells us what the truth *isn't*, which gets us closer to what the truth *is*.
