# Scientific Definitions

Language matters, especially when debugging reality.

**Scientific Definitions** are precise labels for different levels of knowledge, often misused in daily conversation.

In everyday life, "theory" means a hunch ("I have a theory about who stole my lunch"). In science, that's an insult. In science, a **Fact** is a single data point (The screen is black). A **Hypothesis** is a testable guess (The battery is dead). A **Theory** is the comprehensive explanation of how batteries and electricity work. A **Law** is the mathematical formula calculating how long the battery will last. Mixing these up is like confusing a single brick (Fact) with the blueprint for the whole building (Theory).

## The Heirarchy of Knowledge

*   **Fact:** An observation.
    *   *Example:* "The apple fell."
*   **Hypothesis:** A testable explanation for an observation.
    *   *Example:* "Apples fall because an invisible force pulls them."
*   **Law:** A description (often mathematical) of *how* it happens.
    *   *Example:* $F = G \frac{m_1 m_2}{r^2}$ (Calculates the force exactly).
    *   *Note:* Laws tell you *what* will happen, but not *why*.
*   **Theory:** The highest level of understanding. An explanation of *why* it happens, supported by facts, laws, and tested hypotheses.
    *   *Example:* The Theory of General Relativity (Explains gravity is warping of space-time).

## FAQs

*1. Is a Theory less than a Fact?*
No. A Theory is the *explanation* for facts. You can have facts without a theory (we knew gravity existed before we knew why), but a Theory is the gold standard because it explains *why* the facts are there.

*2. Does a Hypothesis become a Theory, which becomes a Law?*
No! This is the video game model of science, and it's wrong.
*   **Hypothesis** $\rightarrow$ Tested $\rightarrow$ Supported/Rejected.
*   **Laws** describe patterns.
*   **Theories** explain mechanisms.
A Theory never becomes a Law, just like a map (explanation) never becomes the road (description).
