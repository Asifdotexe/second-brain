# Falsifiability

The ability to be proven wrong.

**Falsifiability** is the defining characteristic of a scientific theory. It means that there must be a way to test the theory where it *could* fail.
If a theory explains *everything* no matter what happens, it explains *nothing*. It is not science; it is a belief system.

## The Swan Analogy

*   **Theory:** "All swans are white."
    *   **Is it Falsifiable?** Yes. All you need to do is find **one** [[black-swan|black swan]] to prove it false.
*   **Theory:** "Ghosts exist, but they are invisible when you look for them."
    *   **Is it Falsifiable?** No. There is no test you can run to prove they *don't* exist. Therefore, it is not science.

## FAQs

*1. Who came up with this?*
**Karl Popper**. He noticed that Einstein's Physics made risky predictions (that could be wrong), while Freud's Psychology could explain any patient's behavior after the fact. He wanted to separate the two.

*2. Does "Falsifiable" mean "False"?*
No! It means **"Able to be proven false."**
"The Earth is round" is falsifiable (we could go to space and check). It just happens to be true.
