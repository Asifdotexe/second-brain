# Scientific Consensus

The Jury Verdict, not a Popularity Contest.

**Scientific Consensus** is the collective judgment, position, and opinion of the community of scientists in a particular field of study.

It works like a massive, global jury in a courtroom that never closes. One scientist presenting a new idea is like a lawyer making an opening statement. It's interesting, but it's not a verdict. The "verdict" (consensus) only happens after thousands of other scientists (the jury) have examined the evidence, tried to tear it apart, repeated the experiments, and failed to prove it wrong. It represents the best available explanation we have right now, based on strict scrutiny, not just what people "feel" is true.

## How It Forms
Consensus is built on a pyramid of evidence, not just raising hands.

*   **Hypothesis:** An idea is proposed.
*   **Peer Review:** Other experts check the work for errors.
*   **Replication:** Other labs do the same experiment to see if they get the same result.
*   **Meta-Analysis:** Combining results from hundreds of studies to see the big picture.
*   **Consensus:** When the evidence is so overwhelming that the community stops arguing *if* it's happening and starts studying *how* it works.

## FAQs

*1. Is the consensus always right?*
No. The scientific consensus has been wrong before (e.g., we used to think Earth was the center of the universe). However, it is the **most reliable** guide we have at any given moment because it requires the most amount of evidence to overturn. To beat the consensus, you don't need a YouTube video; you need better data.

*2. Why do scientists disagree if there is a consensus?*
Consensus usually exists on the "Big Picture" (e.g., "The climate is warming"), but scientists still argue about the details (e.g., "Exactly how fast is it warming?"). Disagreement on details makes the core consensus stronger, not weaker, because it shows the system of scrutiny is working.
