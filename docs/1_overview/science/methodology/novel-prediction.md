# Novel Prediction

The fortune teller who actually gets it right.

A **Novel Prediction** is when a scientific theory predicts a phenomenon that **no one has ever seen before**, and it turns out to be true.

It is the strongest possible evidence for a theory. Explaining old data is easy (hindsight is 20/20). Predicting the unknown is hard.

## The Halley's Comet Example

*   **Old Science:** Comets are random angry gods.
*   **Edmond Halley (Using Newton's Laws):** "I predict this comet will return in exactly 76 years, on this specific date."
*   **The Result:** It appeared exactly when he said. This proved Newton's physics wasn't just a good story; it was a map of reality.

## The Einstein Example

Einstein's General Relativity predicted that gravity bends light. No one had ever seen bent light.
During a solar eclipse in 1919, Arthur Eddington looked at the stars behind the sun. They were shifted. Einstein was right. The world changed overnight.

## FAQs

*1. Why is it better than explaining known facts?*
Because you can't cheat.
If you know the answer ($\pi$), you can easily invent a math formula to equal $\pi$. But if you write a formula that predicts a number no one has ever measured, and *then* we measure it and you're right... that's magic.
