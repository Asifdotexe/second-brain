# Scientific Laws

Descriptions, not rules.

A **Scientific Law** is a statement that describes an observable occurrence in nature that appears to always be true.
It tells you **What** happens, not **Why** it happens.

*   **The Law:** $F = ma$ (Newton's Second Law).
    *   It describes exactly how a rock moves when you kick it.
*   **The Theory:** General Relativity.
    *   It explains *why* gravity exists (warped spacetime).

## The Misconception

We often think of Laws like "Traffic Laws" (rules imposed by a government).
Nature's Laws are descriptive patterns, not prescriptions. The universe doesn't "obey" the law of gravity; the law of gravity is just our best description of what the universe already does.

## FAQs

*1. Is a Theory a "baby Law"?*
No. This is the biggest myth in science ed.
*   **Fact:** Observation.
*   **Law:** Description of the pattern.
*   **Theory:** Explanation of the mechanism.
A Theory never becomes a Law. They do different things. Evolution is a Theory (it explains). Gravity is a Law (it describes) AND a Theory (it explains).

*2. Can laws change?*
Yes. Newton's Laws were considered absolute for 200 years. Then Einstein showed they were slightly wrong at high speeds. We didn't throw them away (they still work for cars), but we updated the description.
