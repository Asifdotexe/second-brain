# Quantum Computing

Calculating every path through the maze at once.

Classical computers (like the one you are using) think in **Bits** (0 OR 1).
Quantum computers think in **Qubits** (0 AND 1, at the same time).

This allows them to solve specific types of massive problems (like folding proteins for drug discovery or breaking [[encryption]]) exponentially faster than a [[supercomputer]].

## Superposition & Entanglement

*   **Superposition:** A coin spinning on a table is neither Heads nor Tails; it is a blur of both. That is a Qubit.
*   **Entanglement:** Two spinning coins are linked. If you stop one and it lands Heads, the other one *instantly* becomes Tails, even if it is on Mars.

## FAQs

*1. Will it replace my laptop?*
No. They are giant, fragile fridges that need to be kept near Absolute Zero (-273°C). They are for specific science/math tasks, not scrolling Twitter.

*2. Will it break [[encryption|encryption]]?*
Eventually, yes. [[shors-algorithm|Shor's-Algorithm]] proves a powerful enough Quantum Computer could crack all modern flexible [[encryption]]. This is why "Post-Quantum [[cryptography|Cryptography]]" is being researched now.

## How do we use them?

We use software like **[[qiskit|IBM Qiskit]]**. It's a Python library that lets you write code (circuits) on your laptop, which is then sent to a real Quantum Computer (via the cloud) to be executed.
