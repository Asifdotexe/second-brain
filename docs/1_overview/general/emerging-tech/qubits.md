# Qubit

Being 0 and 1 at the same time.

A **Qubit** (Quantum Bit) is the basic unit of information in a quantum computer.
While a classical Bit is like a light switch (On or Off), a Qubit is like a **Dimmer Switch**, it can be in a state of "on", "off", or any setting in between (Superposition).

## The Power of Exponentials

*   2 Classical Bits = 1 number (00, 01, 10, or 11).
*   2 Qubits = All 4 numbers at once.
*   300 Qubits = Can hold more states than there are atoms in the universe.

## FAQs

*1. How do you make one?*
It's hard. You use things like a single electron trapped in a magnetic field, or a photon (light particle). They are incredibly sensitive; if a vibration or heat touches them, they lose their quantum state (Decoherence) and become useless regular bits.
