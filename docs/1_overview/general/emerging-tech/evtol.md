# eVTOL (Electric Vertical Take-Off and Landing)

The flying car, finally realized.

**eVTOL** stands for **Electric Vertical Take-Off and Landing**.
It is a new class of aircraft that uses electric power to hover, take off, and land vertically like a helicopter, but flies efficiently forward like an airplane.

## Key Features

1.  **Electric:** Much quieter and cheaper to run than gas helicopters.
2.  **Distributed Propulsion:** Instead of one big rotor (single point of failure), it usually has 6-12 small rotors. If one breaks, the others compensate so you don't crash.
3.  **Urban Air Mobility (UAM):** Designed for short hops across a city (e.g., Airport to Downtown in 10 mins instead of 1 hour traffic).

## FAQs

*1. Is it just a drone?*
Basically, yes. A giant, passenger-carrying drone. Many will eventually be autonomous (no pilot), reducing the cost even further.

*2. When can I ride one?*
Soon. Companies like **Joby Aviation**, **Archer**, and **Wisk** are already testing them and aiming for commercial FAA certification around 2025-2026. The Paris 2024 Olympics planned to showcase them.
