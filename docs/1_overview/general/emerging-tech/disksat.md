# DiskSat

Stacking satellites like dinner plates.

**DiskSat** is a new satellite form factor developed by NASA and industry partners. Instead of the traditional "Box" shape (CubeSat), it is a flat, circular **Disk** (about 1 meter wide and 2.5cm thick).

## The Problem
Rockets have limited space. Traditional boxy satellites waste volume because they don't pack tightly. You often launch a rocket that is full of empty air between safe-guards.

## The Solution
Disks can be stacked on top of each other in a launcher.
*   **Massive Surface Area:** Because it lies flat, once it deploys, it acts as its own solar panel and antenna. You don't need complex, breakable "unfolding wings."
*   **Maneuverability:** It flies like a frisbee in the thin atmosphere, using air drag to change orbits without fuel.

## FAQs

*1. Who makes it?*
It is currently being tested by NASA and Rocket Lab.

*2. Why do we care?*
It drastically lowers the cost of launch. A single rocket could deploy a "stack" of 50 internet satellites as easily as dispensing PEZ candies.
