# Non-Terrestrial Networks (NTN)

**Think of it like putting cell towers in the sky.**

**Non-Terrestrial Networks (NTN)** is a standardized term for any communication network that uses flying components (satellites, drones, or balloons) to connect devices, rather than relying solely on towers built on the ground.

Traditionally, if you walked too far into the desert or ocean, your phone died because it couldn't "see" a tower. NTN aims to fix this by integrating satellites directly into the standard 5G network. Instead of needing a special bulky satellite phone, your normal smartphone explicitly switches to talking to a satellite when it loses the ground signal, keeping you connected seamlessly anywhere on Earth.

## Key Types
*   **LEO Satellites (Low Earth Orbit):** Satellites flying fast and close to Earth (like Starlink). They offer fast speeds and low lag but you need a lot of them to cover the globe.
*   **Drones / HAPS (High Altitude Platform Stations):** Solar-powered gliders that fly in the stratosphere (above planes but below space) for months, acting like a super-tall cell tower for a specific city or disaster zone.

## FAQs

*1. Will this replace normal 5G?*
No. Satellites can't handle the massive amount of data that fiber-optic connected ground towers can. NTN is a "gap filler"; it covers the oceans, deserts, and rural areas where building towers is too expensive or impossible.

*2. Do I need a new phone?*
Mostly, yes. While some very basic "SOS via Satellite" features work on current phones, true high-speed NTN internet will likely require chips with special antennas. However, the goal of standards (like "SpaceRAN") is to make the technology compatible with future mass-market phones, not just specialized heavy-duty gear.
