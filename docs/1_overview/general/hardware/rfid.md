# RFID

The wireless barcode.

**RFID** uses electromagnetic fields to automatically identify and track tags attached to objects. Unlike a barcode, you don't need line-of-sight; the scanner just needs to be nearby (ranging from inches to hundreds of feet).

## Active vs. Passive

*   **Passive Tags:** Have no battery. They wake up when the reader's radio wave hits them, use that energy to beep back their ID, and go back to sleep. (Cheap, used in shipping labels, hotel keys).
*   **Active Tags:** Have a battery. Can transmit signals over long distances. (Used in toll booth transponders like E-ZPass).

## FAQs

*1. Can I be tracked?*
Technically yes, if you carry RFID tags (like in some passports or clothing). This is why "Faraday Wallets" exist (metal-lined wallets to block the signal).
