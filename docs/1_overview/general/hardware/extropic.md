# Extropic

Nature doesn't fight noise; it rides it.

**Extropic** is a computing company building "Thermodynamic Computers" that use the natural thermal noise of the universe to power AI, rather than spending energy to suppress it.

Think of it like **A Ball on a Table**.
*   **Traditional Computing (Digital):** You want the ball to stay perfectly still (0) or move perfectly to the right (1). But the table is constantly vibrating (thermal noise/heat). You have to spend massive amounts of energy (cooling, error correction) to force the table to be flat and the ball to be still.
*   **Thermodynamic Computing (Extropic):** You *tilt* the vibrating table. You let the natural vibrations (heat) shake the ball around, and you just guide it generally downhill. You use the "noise" as the engine that moves the ball.
Instead of fighting physics to create order, they use the chaos of physics to perform calculations (specifically, probability sampling).

## Key Concepts

*   **Thermodynamic Computing:** A new paradigm where the hardware is designed to relax into a lower energy state, which mathematically corresponds to finding the answer to a problem (like how a ball naturally finds the bottom of a hill).
*   **p-bits (Probabilistic Bits):** Unlike a bit that is definitely 0 or 1, a p-bit is *probabilistically* 0 or 1. It flickers like a coin flipping in the air. This is perfect for AI, which is all about probability ("Is this image 80% likely to be a cat?").
*   **Jellium:** A state of matter (electron gas) used as an analogy for their chip's substrate. They treat the electrons in their chip like a fluid that can inherently perform complex math just by flowing.

## FAQs

*1. Why do we need this?*
The "Energy Wall." We are running out of electricity to power bigger AI Models. Traditional chips ([[gpu|GPUs]]) are becoming heaters that occasionally do math. Extropic claims their chips can be orders of magnitude more efficient because they don't fight heat; they run *on* it.

*2. Is this Quantum Computing?*
No, but it's related. [[quantum-computing|Quantum Computers]] use quantum mechanics (entanglement). Extropic uses *Thermodynamics* (statistical mechanics). It fits in the gap between classical chips (too rigid) and quantum chips (too fragile). It works at room temperature.
