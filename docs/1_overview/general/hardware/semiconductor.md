# Semiconductor

The brain cells of modern electronics.

A **Semiconductor** is a material (usually Silicon) that sits halfway between a Conductor (allows electricity to flow, like Copper) and an Insulator (blocks electricity, like Rubber).

By adding impurities ("doping"), we can make it switch between conducting and blocking electricity instantly. This allows us to build **Transistors**; tiny on/off switches that represent the 1s and 0s of computer code.

## Why it matters

Everything digital (Phones, Cars, Toasters, AI) runs on chips made of billions of microscopic transistors printed on silicon wafers.

## FAQs

*1. What is the Chip Shortage?*
Making chips is the hardest manufacturing process on Earth (using lasers to carve paths smaller than a virus). Only a few factories (fabs) exist. When demand spikes, it takes years to build a new factory.
