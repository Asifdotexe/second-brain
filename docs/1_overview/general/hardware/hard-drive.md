# Hard Drive (HDD / SSD)

The long-term memory of the computer.

The **Hard Drive** is where your data lives when the power is turned off.
If **RAM** is your tabletop (fast, temporary workspace), the **Hard Drive** is the filing cabinet (slower, permanent storage).

## The Two Titans

### 1. HDD (Hard Disk Drive) - The Record Player
*   **Technology:** Fast-spinning magnetic platters with a mechanical arm that reads data.
*   **Pros:** Very cheap for huge amounts of space (8TB, 16TB).
*   **Cons:** Slow, loud, fragile (if you drop it, the needle scratches the record and data dies).

### 2. SSD (Solid State Drive) - The Flash Card
*   **Technology:** Lightning-fast electrical chips with no moving parts.
*   **Pros:** Instant speed, silent, durable.
*   **Cons:** More expensive per gigabyte (though getting cheaper).

## FAQs

*1. NVMe vs SATA?*
*   **SATA:** The old cable connection (Max speed ~600 MB/s).
*   **NVMe (M.2):** The new stick that plugs directly into the motherboard (Max speed ~7,000 MB/s). Always buy NVMe for your main [[operating-system|Operating System]] drive.

*2. How long do they last?*
Usually 5-10 years. But they *will* fail.
**Rule of thumb:** Data that doesn't exist in at least two places (Backup) doesn't exist at all.
