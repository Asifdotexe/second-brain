# NFC (Near Field Communication)

The digital handshake.

**NFC** is a short-range wireless technology (max distance ~4cm) that lets two devices talk when they touch or get very close.

It is a subtype of **[[rfid|RFID]]**, but designed for secure, two-way communication.

## Use Cases

1.  **Payments:** Apple Pay / Google Pay (Tap to pay).
2.  **Access:** Opening office doors with a badge or phone.
3.  **Pairing:** Tapping headphones to a phone to connect Bluetooth instantly.

## FAQs

*1. Is it safe to leave on?*
Generally, yes. Because the range is tiny (inches), a hacker would have to physically bump into you with a reader to steal data ("Skimming"), which is difficult in practice.
