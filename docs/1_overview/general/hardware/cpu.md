# CPU (Central Processing Unit)

The Professor.

**The CPU** is the primary brain of a computer. It is designed to interpret and execute generalized commands from software.

Think of it like **A Professor**.
*   **The Professor (CPU):** Extremely smart and versatile. Can solve complex calculus, write poetry, or organize a schedule. But can only do *one thing at a time*.
*   **The Factory ([[gpu|GPU]]):** Not smart, but has 1,000 workers who can all stack boxes at once.
*   **The Specialist ([[tpu|TPU]]):** A savant who can only do matrix multiplication, but does it faster than anyone else.

## How it Works

1.  **Sequential Processing:** The CPU reads instruction 1, does it. Reads instruction 2, does it. It is optimized for "Latency" (finishing one task fast) rather than "Throughput" (finishing many tasks at once).
2.  **General Purpose:** It can run *any* code; Operating Systems, Games, Excel, Browsers. It is the conductor that tells the other chips (GPU, Disk, Network) what to do.

## FAQs

*1. Why do I need a GPU if I have a CPU?*
Because the Professor is too slow at painting. If you ask a Professor to modify 2 million pixels on a screen 60 times a second (gaming), they will fail. You need the Factory (GPU) for that.

*2. Does AI use the CPU?*
Yes, for logic and data preparation. But for the heavy "training" (math), it offloads the work to [[npu|NPUs]] (on phones) or [[tpu|TPUs]] (in the cloud).
