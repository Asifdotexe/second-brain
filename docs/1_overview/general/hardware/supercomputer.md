# Supercomputer

The Formula 1 car of computing.

A **Supercomputer** isn't just a "fast laptop." It is an entirely different architecture designed to solve one massive math problem at a time by linking thousands of processors together.

Your laptop is designed to do many things at once (Email, Spotify, Chrome).
A Supercomputer is designed to simulate **Nuclear Explosions** or **Global Weather Patterns**.

## How it Works

**Parallel Processing.**
Imagine you need to read a library of 10,000 books.
*   **Fast Computer:** One genius reading 1 book per second. (Total: 2.7 hours).
*   **Supercomputer:** 10,000 average people reading 1 book each *at the same time*. (Total: 1 second).

## FLOPs

We measure them in **FLOPS** (Floating Point Operations Per Second).
*   **Current Champion:** **Frontier** (Oak Ridge National Lab).
*   **Speed:** Exascale (1.1 ExaFLOPS). That is 1,100,000,000,000,000,000 calculations per second.

## FAQs

*1. Does it run Windows?*
No. Almost 100% of the world's supercomputers run **Linux**. It is the only OS flexible and efficient enough to manage that much hardware.

*2. Where are they?*
Universities, Government Labs, and Massive tech companies (Meta/Google for AI training).
