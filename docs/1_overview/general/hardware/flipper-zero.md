# Flipper Zero

The Swiss Army knife for geeks.

The **Flipper Zero** is a portable, tamagotchi-like multi-tool for pentesters and hardware geeks. It houses antennas for almost every common radio protocol: **[[nfc|NFC]]**, **[[rfid|RFID]]**, **Infrared** (TV remotes), **Sub-GHz** (Garage doors), and **iButton**.

## Why is it famous/infamous?
It makes hardware hacking accessible.
*   **Cool usage:** Cloning your office keycard so you don't lose it. Turning off all TV screens in a bar (TV-B-Gone).
*   **Bad usage:** "SPAM Attacks" that crash iPhones by flooding them with Bluetooth pairing requests (Apple fixed this, but Flipper popularized it).

## FAQs

*1. Is it illegal?*
No. The device itself is legal hardware. *Using* it to open a Tesla charge port you don't own or clone a stranger's card is illegal.
