# LiDAR

Bats using lasers instead of sound.

You know how bats use **Sonar** (Sound Navigation)? They scream, and listen for the echo to know where the wall is.

**LiDAR** (Light Detection and Ranging) does the exact same thing, but with **Lasers**. It shoots millions of invisible laser beams per second and measures how long they take to bounce back.

## What it sees

It creates a "Point Cloud"; a precise 3D map of the world.
*   **Cameras** see color (2D).
*   **LiDAR** sees distance (3D). It knows exactly that the tree is 15.2 meters away, not 15.1.

## FAQs

*1. Where is it used?*
*   **Self-Driving Cars:** The spinning bucket on top of the car. It tells the car "There is a pedestrian 20 meters ahead."
*   **iPhones:** New pros have a tiny LiDAR scanner to help with Focus and Augmented Reality (AR).
*   **Archaeology:** Discovering lost cities hidden under thick jungle canopies by seeing "through" the leaves.

*2. Is it safe?*
Yes. The lasers are low power and invisible. They won't hurt your eyes.
