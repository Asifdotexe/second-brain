# GPU

A factory with thousands of workers, instead of one genius.

The **[[cpu|CPU]]** (Central Processing Unit) in your computer is like a **Professor**: extremely smart, can do complex math (calculus), but can only do one or two things at a time.

The **GPU** (Graphics Processing Unit) is like a **Factory** full of thousands of workers: they aren't very smart (basic math only), but they can do 10,000 simple things at the exact same time.

## Why is it used for AI?

AI (and Video Games) require changing millions of pixels or calculating millions of numbers simultaneously.
*   **[[cpu|CPU]]:** Solves one complex equation in 0.1 seconds.
*   **GPU:** Solves 10,000 simple equations in 0.1 seconds.
*   *(See also: [[tpu|TPUs]] for specialized AI/Cloud training and [[npu|NPUs]] for mobile AI).*

## FAQs

*1. Can I use a GPU for normal work?*
You use it every day! It draws the windows on your screen. But for running Excel or Word, your CPU does the heavy lifting because those tasks are sequential (step-by-step), not parallel.

*2. Why are they so expensive?*
Supply and Demand. They are the shovels in the AI Gold Rush. Everyone from gamers to Google needs them to run modern software.
