# Operating System (OS)

The conductor of the digital orchestra.

The **Operating System** is the software that manages the hardware and provides a playground for applications to run.
Without an OS, your computer is just a pile of metal and silicon. The OS tells the CPU, RAM, and Screen how to talk to each other.

## The Hierarchy

1.  **Hardware:** The metal (CPU, Disk).
2.  **Kernel:** The Heart of the OS (Talks to metal).
3.  **Shell/UI:** The Face of the OS (Start Menu, Desktop).
4.  **Applications:** The Tools (Chrome, Steam, Excel).

## Major Families

*   **Windows (Microsoft):** The Office & Gaming standard. User-friendly.
*   **macOS (Apple):** The Creative standard. Based on Unix (very stable).
*   **Linux (Open Source):** The Server & Hacker standard. Runs the internet.

## FAQs
