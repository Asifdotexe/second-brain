Tbps stands for Terabits per second, a unit of data transfer rate equal to 1 trillion bits per second (10¹² bits/s).

Terabit per second (Tbps): 1 Tbps = 1,000 gigabits per second (Gbps) = 1 trillion bits per second. 
Terabyte per second (TBps): Often confused with Tbps, 1 TBps equals 8 Tbps, as 1 byte = 8 bits.
