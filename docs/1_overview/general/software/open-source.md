# Open Source

A recipe that everyone can cook, improve, and share.

Most software (like Windows or Photoshop) is **Closed Source**. You buy the cake, but you can't see the recipe. You can't change the flavor or check if they put poison in it.

**Open Source** software is when the code (the recipe) is public. Anyone can read it, change it, and distribute their own version.

## Why it wins

1.  **Trust:** You don't have to trust the company; you can check the code yourself.
2.  **Innovation:** Instead of 100 employees at Microsoft working on it, you have 10,000 developers around the world fixing bugs and adding features.
3.  **Cost:** It is usually free.

## FAQs

*1. How do they make money?*
They give the software away for free, but sell:
*   **Support:** "We will help you fix it if it breaks."
*   **Hosting:** "We will run it for you so you don't have to." (e.g., WordPress).
*   **Features:** "The basic version is free, but the Enterprise version costs money."

*2. Examples?*
*   **Linux:** Runs the entire internet and Android phones.
*   **VLC Player:** The video player that plays everything.
*   **Firefox:** The web browser.
