# Cryptomining Software

Computer programs designed to solve complex mathematical problems ("hashes") in order to secure a blockchain and earn cryptocurrency rewards.

While cryptomining software has legitimate uses, it is frequently used by hackers in unauthorized ways to steal processing power.

## Legitimate vs. Malicious Use

- **Legitimate Miner**: A user intentionally installs software (like NiceHash or PhoenixMiner) on their own hardware to earn crypto. They pay for their own electricity and hardware wear-and-tear.
- **Malicious Miner**: A hacker secretly installs a mining script or program on a victim's device without their knowledge. This is known as **[[cryptojacking]]**.

## How it Impacts Systems
- **CPU/GPU Saturation**: The software tries to use 100% of available processing power, making the computer laggy.
- **Heat & Wear**: Running hardware at max capacity for long periods can cause permanent damage or shortened lifespan.
- **Energy Cost**: Cryptomining is extremely power-hungry; unauthorized mining can cause massive spikes in electricity bills.

## Detection
Advanced [[antivirus|antivirus]] and [[EDR]] systems often flag legitimate cryptomining software as "Potentially Unwanted Programs" (PUPs) because they are so commonly associated with [[malware|malware]] infections.
