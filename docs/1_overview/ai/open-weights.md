# Open Weights

The brain without the memory.

When an AI company releases **Open Weights**, they are giving you the *result* of their training (the smart brain), but not the *data* (the books it read) or the *recipe* (the code) used to create it.

It's like a chef giving you a delicious cake. You can eat it, share it, and even put new icing on it, but you don't know exactly what ingredients went into baking it.

## The Difference

*   **Open Source AI:** You get everything. The Code + The Training Data + The Weights. (Rare).
*   **Open Weights:** You get just the trained model. You can run it, but you can't easily rebuild it from scratch. (Common, e.g., Llama 3, Mistral).

## FAQs

*1. Can I use it for free?*
Usually, yes. However, "Open Weights" often come with specific licenses. For example, some might say "Free for everyone, unless you have more than 700 million users."

*2. Why do companies do this?*
It allows the community to improve the model (fixing bugs, making it run faster) without the company giving away their "secret sauce" (their proprietary training data).
