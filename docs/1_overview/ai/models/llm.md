# Large Language Model

Think of an LLM as "really really really good Autocomplete", a system that has read almost everything on the internet and learned how to predict the next word in a sentence perfectly.

It is trained on massive amounts of text data. Instead of being "taught" grammar rules explicitly, it learns them by observing patterns. 

Its primary job is simple: **Guess the next word.** By making these guesses billions of times over, it learns to write essays, code software, translate languages, and answer questions.

## How It Actually Works

To understand an LLM, we break it down into three fundamental pillars:

**1. Tokenization (The Puzzle Pieces)**
Computers don't read words like we do; they read numbers. An LLM breaks text down into chunks called *Tokens*. A token can be a whole word (like "apple") or part of a word (like "ing" in "eating"). During processing, these tokens are converted into highly complex mathematical vectors called **[[embeddings]]** to help the model understand their deeper meaning.

**2. Probability (The Guessing Game)**
The model looks at a sequence of tokens and calculates the *probability* of what comes next.
* *Input:* "The cat sat on the..."
* *LLM Calculation:*
    * "Mat" (80% likely)
    * "Floor" (15% likely)
    * "Moon" (0.01% likely)

**3. The Model Lifecycle (From Raw Data to Helpful Assistant)**
Modern LLMs go through a rigorous, multi-stage process before they ever talk to a user:
*   **Pretraining:** The model reads massive amounts of raw internet data (books, websites, articles). Running on thousands of GPUs, it adjusts its internal "settings" (parameters) every time it guesses right or wrong. This creates a "base model" that understands the structure of human language and facts, but it isn't very polite or conversational yet; it just wants to complete sentences.
*   **[[ai-fine-tuning|Fine-Tuning]]:** Developers take the raw base model and explicitly teach it how to behave gracefully in a specific domain (like coding or customer support) by feeding it a smaller set of extremely high-quality, human-curated examples.
*   **[[rlhf|RLHF]] (Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback):** To stop the AI from generating toxic or unhelpful answers, humans rank several AI responses from best to worst. A secondary "reward model" learns these human preferences and mathematically forces the main LLM to be safe, polite, and helpful.
*   **Inference:** Once the model is deployed to the real world, "inference" is the act of the model reading your prompt and generating a response. During inference, developers can adjust the **Temperature** (lower temperature = more deterministic and focused; higher temperature = more creative and random).

## Advanced Concepts
*   **Model Distillation:** Running massive LLMs is incredibly expensive. "Distillation" is the process of training a smaller, cheaper, faster "student" model to mimic the outputs of a massive "teacher" model (like compressing a 100GB file down to 5GB while keeping most of the quality).
*   **Evaluations (Evals):** Just like software needs unit tests, developers run "evals" before releasing a model to see if its quality has regressed. They test the model against standardized benchmarks to measure its coding, math, or reasoning skills.

## FAQ

*1. What is a "[[transformers|Transformer]]"?*
The "Transformer" is the engine under the hood of modern [[llm|LLMs]] (like the 'T' in GPT). 

Before Transformers, AI read sentences one word at a time, left to right. Transformers can read the **whole sentence at once**. This allows the model to understand context much better. 

For example, in the sentence *"The bank was closed because the river flooded,"* a Transformer understands that "bank" refers to land, not money, because it sees the word "river" at the same time.

*2. What are "Parameters"?*

Parameters are the "brain cells" of the model. They are the adjustable variables inside the model that store the knowledge. 
* **More parameters** = generally smarter, more nuanced, and capable of handling complex tasks. 
* GPT-4, for instance, has approximately 1.76 trillion parameters

*3. Why do LLMs hallucinate?*

Since an LLM is a **probabilistic engine**, not a fact database, it sometimes predicts a word that *sounds* plausible but is factually wrong. It prioritizes the *pattern* of language over the *truth* of the facts.

*   **What are "Scaling Laws"?**

In 2020, researchers at OpenAI published *[Scaling Laws for Neural Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.08361)*, proving that as we make models larger and train them with more data and compute power, their performance tends to improve in highly predictable, mathematical ways. By throwing more compute at the problem and building bigger models, researchers achieved progressively better results.

However, in recent years, while "pretraining" scaling continued to work, the industry discovered a massive new lever: **Test-Time Compute**. Instead of purely making the *brain* bigger, researchers began giving the model more time to "think," reason, run tools (enabling paradigms such as [[agentic-ai|Agentic AI]] where models orchestrate and use external tools during inference), and iterate *during* inference (when the user actually asks the question) to vastly improve complex problem-solving.
