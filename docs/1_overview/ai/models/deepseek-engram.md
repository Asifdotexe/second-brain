# DeepSeek Engram

**Think of it like moving a mansion using a fleet of small cars instead of one giant truck.**

**DeepSeek Engram** is a distributed AI training method designed to build massive, cutting-edge models using older, less powerful computer chips.

Normally, training a "Super AI" (like GPT-4) requires putting the entire model into the memory of extremely expensive, bleeding-edge chips (like Nvidia H100s) connected by ultra-fast cables. If you use slow chips, the system crashes or takes 100 years. "Engram" changes the math by breaking the model into tiny, independent "parcels" that can be processed by cheap, older consumer cards. It allows a thousand cheap chips to do the work of a hundred super-chips, bypassing the need for sanctioned hardware.

## How it Works
*   **Micro-Sharding (The Breakdown):** Engram slices the AI's "brain" into millions of tiny pieces. Instead of one chip needing to hold 10% of the brain, it only holds 0.001%.
*   **Asynchronous Sync (The Traffic Control):** Traditional training requires all chips to talk to each other instantly (like a conference call). Engram allows chips to report back "whenever they are ready" (like sending emails); meaning slow internet cables between chips don't slow down the whole project.

## FAQs

*1. Does this make the AI smarter?*
No, it makes the AI *cheaper* and *uncensorable*. The resulting intelligence is the same, but the "barrier to entry" drops. DeepSeek Engram allows nations or companies without access to US technology to build world-class AI using 5-year-old gaming parts.

*2. Why didn't we do this before?*
It was mathematically very hard. Getting thousands of slow, disconnected chips to agree on a complex math problem without corrupting the data is difficult. DeepSeek solved the "coordination chaos" that usually happens when you try to split a task too many times.
