# AI Water Usage

The Drop in the Bucket.

**The "AI Water Crisis"** is a counter-intuitive narrative that AI data centers are draining local water supplies. The data suggests this is largely a **Context Error**.

Think of it like **Worrying about a Dripping Faucet during a Flood**.
*   **The Flood (Agriculture):** 93% of humanity's water footprint goes to growing food and industrial processes.
*   **The Faucet (Households/Data Centers):** Domestic use is ~1%. Data Centers are a fraction of that (0.13% of US potable water).
Headlines claiming "ChatGPT uses a bottle of water per email" are factually true but contextually misleading, similar to saying "Your cat drinks 10,000 drops of water a day."

## Key Definitions

To understand the numbers, we need to separate different *types* of water use.

### 1. Consumptive vs. Non-Consumptive
*   **Consumptive Use (evaporation):** Taking water and removing it from the local ecosystem (usually by evaporating it).
    *   *Example:* Boiling a pot of pasta until dry, or growing an almond (the water becomes the almond).
    *   *Data Centers:* Evaporative cooling towers dissolve water into the air. It’s gone from the local watershed.
*   **Non-Consumptive Use (borrowing):** Taking water, using it, and putting it back.
    *   *Example:* A hydroelectric dam or a water wheel. The water flows through and keeps going.
    *   *Relevance:* Most water "used" by power plants is non-consumptive (cooling), yet critics often count this huge number as "lost" water.

### 2. Direct vs. Indirect
*   **Direct Use:** Water used *at* the data center (onsite) to cool the servers.
*   **Indirect Use:** Water used *at the power plant* to generate the electricity the data center burns.
    *   *The Trap:* Critics often combine these numbers to make AI look worse. However, 80% of this "indirect" water is non-consumptive (just flowing through the power plant).

### 3. Potable vs. Non-Potable
*   **Potable:** Drinkable, treated water.
*   **Non-Potable:** Raw freshwater or "grey water" (wastewater).
    *   *Context:* Data centers often use potable water because it's cleaner for the pipes (no sediment). However, in 2023, data centers used only **0.13%** of the US public water supply.

## The Core Argument

1.  **Scale Mismatch:** Critics often compare AI water usage to "millions of homes." This sounds huge because we assume homes use a lot of water. They don't (compared to farms).
2.  **Trade-offs:** Data centers use water for *cooling*. The alternative is air conditioning (using massive electricity). Water cooling is often the "greener" choice for the planet, even if it uses local water.
3.  **Potability:** Ideally, data centers shouldn't use drinkable (potable) water. Many are switching to "grey water" (recycled wastewater), rendering the argument moot.

## Key Stats

*   **0.13%:** The percentage of US potable water used by data centers in 2023.
*   **Growth:** Even with 10x AI growth, it would reach ~0.3% of supply.
*   **Perspective:** An electric car factory often uses as much water as a data center, yet rarely faces the same "moral" scrutiny.
