# AI Psychosis

When financial markets or society at large experience sudden, severe panic and irrational behavior based solely on speculative, future-state predictions of AI capabilities, rather than current economic reality.

**AI Psychosis** is a modern socio-economic phenomenon where the anxiety surrounding the future impact of artificial intelligence triggers highly disproportionate real-world consequences in the present out of sheer speculative fear.

Because the ultimate economic endpoint of mass AI adoption remains in a "William Gibson zone"; where the future is arriving but unevenly distributed; the financial system is intensely jittery. Even loosely substantiated thought experiments can trigger massive market selloffs.

## The 2028 Global Intelligence Crisis (Alap Shah)

A defining example of AI Psychosis occurred in early 2026. A financial analyst named Alap Shah and the research firm Citrini published a "thought exercise" titled *The 2028 Global Intelligence Crisis*.

The report predicted that by June 2028, mass adoption of [[agentic-ai|Agentic AI]] workflows would drive unemployment past 10%. The report theorized that when every consumer has access to dozens of personal AI agents, traditional "rent-seeking" middlemen and aggregators (like DoorDash or heavy logistics software) will be bypassed entirely by AI negotiating directly with suppliers.

Despite intense criticism of the report's economic logic; and the fact that AI had not yet caused near-total labor substitution; its mere publication hit Wall Street with immense force, leading to an immediate 800-point drop in the Dow Jones as panicked investors dumped logistics and aggregator stocks out of pure future-state fear.

## Key Themes

*   **The Reverse Flywheel:** The core fear driving AI Psychosis is a negative economic loop: agents take jobs $\rightarrow$ people have less money $\rightarrow$ consumer spending drops $\rightarrow$ corporations conduct further layoffs.
*   **Vulnerability of Middlemen:** The market is most reactive to theories suggesting that [[agentic-ai|Autonomous Agents]] will achieve zero-friction direct contracting, entirely eliminating the need for app-based "middlemen" businesses.
