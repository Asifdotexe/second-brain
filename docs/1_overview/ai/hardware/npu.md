# NPU (Neural Processing Unit)

The Brain in Your Pocket.

**An NPU** is a specialized processor found in smartphones and laptops designed to run AI tasks efficiently locally ("on the edge"), rather than sending data to the cloud.

Think of it like **Reflexes vs. Thinking**.
*   **[[tpu|TPU]] (Cloud):** Like a supercomputer solving a complex math problem. It takes huge power and time.
*   **NPU (Edge):** Like your hand pulling away from a hot stove. It’s not "smart" in a general sense, but it is instant and happens right where the action is.
When your phone unlocks with FaceID or blurs the background in a Zoom call, that's the NPU. It does the heavy AI lifting so your battery doesn't die.

## How it Works

1.  **Inference Only:** Unlike huge GPUs that *train* models (teach them), NPUs mostly *run* models (inference). They take a pre-trained brain and just use it.
2.  **Low Power:** They are physically designed to sip battery. Doing the same FaceID calculation on your main CPU would drain your phone in an hour.

## FAQs

*1. Do I have one?*
Yes. If you have a modern iPhone (Apple Neural Engine) or Android (Hexagon), you use it every day for photos, voice-to-text, and battery management.

*2. What's the difference from a GPU?*
Efficiency. A [[gpu|GPU]] *can* do what an NPU does, but it's overkill. It’s like using a flamethrower to light a candle. The NPU is the lighter—purpose-built and safe for your pocket.
