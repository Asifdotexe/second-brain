# Average Annual Loss

**Average Annual Loss (AAL)** is like the yearly budget you set aside for car maintenance; you know you'll pay for oil changes and minor repairs every year, even if you don't crash.

In cyber risk, **Average Annual Loss (AAL)** is the expected average financial loss a company will incur from risks over a specific period (usually a year) when averaged over a very long timeline.

It works by smoothing out the jagged peaks of disaster costs into a predictable annual expense. Instead of panicking when a small incident happens, you treat it as a "pre-paid" operating cost.

## How it Works

*   **The Baseline:** It calculates the "cost of doing business" regarding risk.
*   **High Frequency, Low Severity:** AAL is mostly driven by small, frequent events (like fender benders or minor malware infections) rather than the massive, rare catastrophes.
*   **Budgeting Tool:** Companies use AAL to decide how much premium they should realistically pay for insurance. If the premium is lower than their AAL, it might be a bad deal for the insurer!

## Real-World Analogies

| Context | Analogy |
| :--- | :--- |
| **General** | **Home Maintenance:** You might budget roughly $2,000/year for fixing leaks, painting, and lawn care. Some years you spend $500, others $5,000, but the *average* over 10 years is your AAL. |
| **Cyber Risk** | **The "Cost of Glitches":** A company expects to lose $50,000/year dealing with phishing remediation, reimaging infected laptops, and minor downtime. This is their "Cyber AAL"; the routine cost of digital friction. |

## FAQs

*1. Why should I care about AAL if I have insurance?*
Because AAL represents the losses you are *expected* to eat. Insurers often set your **deductible** near your AAL so they don't have to handle paperwork for routine, small claims.

*2. Is AAL the worst-case scenario?*
No! That’s **Probable Maximum Loss (PML)** or **VaR**. AAL is just the average. If you only prepare for the AAL, you will be bankrupt when the "Big One" hits.
