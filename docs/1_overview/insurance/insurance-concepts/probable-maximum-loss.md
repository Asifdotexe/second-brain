# Probable Maximum Loss (PML)

**Probable Maximum Loss (PML)** is the "realistic worst-case scenario"; it’s the fire that burns down the building, but assumes the fire department eventually shows up.

**Probable Maximum Loss (PML)** is the maximum loss that an insurer or risk manager would expect to incur on a policy, assuming that normal protective measures function as intended.

It contrasts with *Maximum Possible Loss* (MPL), which assumes everything fails (creating a total wipeout). PML is a "bad but plausible" number used to set insurance limits.

## How it Works

*   **Plausibility Filter:** It discards the "meteor strike" scenarios. It focuses on severe but reasonably expected disasters.
*   **The "Functioning" Assumption:** It assumes your sprinklers work (mostly), your firewalls hold (somewhat), and your backups exist (eventually).
*   **Setting Limits:** Companies buy insurance limits equal to their PML. Buying more (MPL) is usually too expensive and unnecessary.

## Real-World Analogies

| Context | Analogy |
| :--- | :--- |
| **General** | **House Fire:**
*   **MPL (Possible):** Fire burns house to ash + destroys garage + kills expensive trees. (Total Loss).
*   **PML (Probable):** Fire starts in kitchen, burns 60% of house before fire trucks arrive. (Realistic Disaster). |
| **Cyber Risk** | **Ransomware Attack:**
*   **MPL:** Hackers encrypt every single server and backup worldwide. Company bankrupt.
*   **PML:** Hackers encrypt the main data center, but offline backups survive. Downtime is 2 weeks, not forever. |

## FAQs

*1. Who decides what is "Probable"?*
Ideally, data. Underwriters use historical data and modeling software. However, it is subjective. One person's PML is another person's optimism.

*2. Should I buy insurance for PML or MPL?*
Usually PML. Insuring for MPL (total annihilation) is often cost-prohibitive. You accept the tiny risk that the "meteor" hits.
