# Risk Transfer

**Risk Transfer** is the business equivalent of paying someone else to worry for you so you can sleep at night.

**Risk Transfer** is a [[risk-management|risk management]] strategy where the burden of a potential loss is shifted from one party to another, typically through insurance policies or contractual indemnification.

Instead of keeping the risk (Retention) or avoiding it (Avoidance), you pay a fee (premium) to make it someone else's problem.

## How it Works

*   **The Contract:** You sign a deal. "If X happens, YOU pay for it, not me."
*   **The Price:** You pay a known cost (Premium) to avoid an unknown, potentially unlimited cost (The Loss).
*   **Not Just Insurance:** You can transfer risk via contracts (e.g., forcing a vendor to be responsible if their software hacks you).

## Real-World Analogies

| Context | Analogy |
| :--- | :--- |
| **General** | **Extended Warranty:** You buy a TV. You worry it often breaks. You pay Best Buy $50. Now, if it breaks, *Best Buy* loses money fixing it, not you. You transferred the risk of defects to them. |
| **Cyber Risk** | **Cloud Providers (Shared Responsibility):** When you move to AWS, you *transfer* the risk of physical server failure to Amazon. You don't worry about the hard drives melting; that's their problem. (Note: You still keep the risk of configuring it securely!). |

## FAQs

*1. Does Risk Transfer eliminate the risk?*
No! The risk still exists; it just lands in someone else's wallet. If the other party goes bankrupt (e.g., your insurer fails), the risk bounces back to you (**Counterparty Risk**).

*2. Can I transfer all risks?*
No. You cannot transfer reputation risk. If you get hacked, customers blame *you*, not your insurance company. You can transfer the *cost* of the fines, but not the *shame*.
