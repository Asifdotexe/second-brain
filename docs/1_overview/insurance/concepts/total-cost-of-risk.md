# Total Cost of Risk (TCoR)

**Total Cost of Risk (TCoR)** is the realization that the sticker price of your insurance premium is just the tip of the iceberg—you also pay for the deductible, the safety team, and the time spent managing it all.

**Total Cost of Risk (TCoR)** is the sum of all costs related to an organization's risk, including insurance premiums, retained losses (deductibles), risk management administrative costs, and taxes/fees.

It proves that buying cheap insurance doesn't always lower your total cost. If you buy cheap insurance (low premium) but have a high deductible and weak security (high losses), your TCoR might skyrocket.

## How it Works

*   **Equation:** TCoR = Insurance Premiums + Retained Losses (Deductibles/Uninsured) + Risk Control Costs (Security tools/staff) + Administrative Costs.
*   **Optimization:** The goal isn't to minimize premiums; it's to minimize TCoR. Sometimes spending *more* on security (Control Costs) lowers your Premiums and Retained Losses enough to reduce the total TCoR.

## Real-World Analogies

| Context | Analogy |
| :--- | :--- |
| **General** | **Car Ownership:** The cost of a car isn't just the monthly loan payment (Premium). It's the Loan + Gas + Repairs + Insurance + Registration. If you buy a "cheap" unreliable car, your Repair costs might make your Total Cost higher than a reliable, expensive car. |
| **Cyber Risk** | **The Security Budget:** `TCoR = Cyber Ins. Premium ($100k) + Deductibles Paid ($50k) + Security Team Salaries ($500k) + Endpoint Protection Software ($20k).` A CISO uses TCoR to justify buying better security tools: "This $20k tool will lower our likely deductible payouts by $100k." |

## FAQs

*1. What are "Retained Losses"?*
The parts of the loss you pay yourself. This includes your **deductible** (the first $X amount of a claim) and any losses that are **excluded** from your policy.

*2. How does risk management lower TCoR?*
By preventing accidents! If you invest in fire sprinklers (or MFA for cyber), you reduce the frequency of claims. This lowers your Retained Losses and eventually convinces insurers to lower your Premiums.
