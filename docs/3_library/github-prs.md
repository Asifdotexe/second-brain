## The Linux "Read Only" Mirror

The Linux kernel does not accept PRs on GitHub (it uses a mailing list). This has led to a genre of "confused" or "joke" PRs on the read-only mirror.

| PR | Description | Link |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **#386** | **The Typo Incident**<br>User tries to fix a typo. Bot politely says "email us". Chaos ensues in comments. | [View PR](https://github.com/torvalds/linux/pull/386) |
| **#486** | **"This Code Very Fast"**<br>A classic joke PR claiming to optimize the kernel for a calculator. | [View PR](https://github.com/torvalds/linux/pull/486) |
| **#698** | **"Remove Extra Spaces"**<br>A bold attempt to remove trailing whitespace from the *entire* kernel at once. | [View PR](https://github.com/torvalds/linux/pull/698) |
