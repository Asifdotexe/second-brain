The term implies that the developers have had **zero days** to fix or patch the issue because they were unaware of its existence before it was discovered or exploited by hackers.\n\n### The Analogy\n**The Invisible Backdoor**\nImagine a construction company builds a thousand identical houses with high-security steel doors. However, they accidentally leave a small, invisible gap under the back door that no one notices\u2014not even the builders.\n* **Zero-Day Vulnerability:** The invisible gap.\n* **Zero-Day Exploit:** A burglar discovering they can slide a wire under that gap to unlock the door.\n* **The Risk:** Since the builders don't know the gap exists, they haven't invented a door sweep to block it. Until they do, every house is defenseless against burglars who know the trick.\n\n### Visual Aid\n<img src=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/58/Vulnerability_timeline.png\" alt=\"Zero-Day Timeline\" style=\"height: 400px; width: 750px;\" />\n\n### Further Reading\n* **Trend Micro:** [What is a Zero-Day Attack?](https://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/us/security/definition/zero-day-vulnerability)\n* **Symantec (Broadcom):** [Zero-day Vulnerabilities Explained](https://us.norton.com/internet-security-emerging-threats-how-do-zero-day-vulnerabilities-work-30-seconds.html)\n* **MITRE CVE:** [Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures](https://cve.mitre.org/) (The database where vulnerabilities are eventually listed)\n"
